<p><span style=""color:#000000"">Our agency regards verification of our tutor&rsquo;s credentials as a key feature and priority. This is to ensure that the tutors we send to our clients&rsquo; place are credible and trustworthy.<br />
<br />
Tutors are literally strangers who are stepping into your home for the first time. You will need assurances that the tutors are whom they claim to be and suitably qualified to teach you or your child. A tutor can claim that he/she has attained a certain qualification and quote a higher <u><a href=""https://tutorcity.sg/tuition-rates"">tuition rate</a></u>, thus there needs to be checks done by our agency to ensure that the tutors&rsquo; credentials are valid. We believe the parents and students deserve to get what they pay for.</span></p>

<p><span style=""color:#000000""><strong><u>The Process of Verification</u></strong><br />
<br />
Collecting and verifying the documents is tedious and time-consuming work for our staffs. However, for the sake of parents and students, we persist in this method of collating information and verifying the tutors before they are sent to our client&rsquo;s home.<br />
<br />
To <u><a href=""https://tutorcity.sg/register-as-tutor"">register as tutor</a></u>, applicants are encouraged to upload a&nbsp;photograph and soft copies of their certificates which we will verify against their particulars.<br />
<br />
Our staffs may be able to judge the tutors through the registration process via phone/SMS. There is a certain aspect which we do our best to verify but cannot guarantee, which is the validity of the tutor&rsquo;s description regarding their past experiences especially for those who had been teaching for many years. We rely on parents&rsquo; feedback on tutors&rsquo; performances which we then pass on to new clients with similar requirements. Any tutor who is found lying about their experience or commitment is black-listed in our <u><a href=""https://tutorcity.sg/search-tutors"">Search Tutors </a></u>database.<br />
<br />
During the first lesson, our tutors will have to bring along their&nbsp;certificates and other documents (e.g. teachers&rsquo; civil service cards) for our parents and students to verify. This is a &lsquo;sure&rsquo; means of verification to further assure you that the tutor is whom they claim to be.</span></p>

<p><span style=""color:#000000"">The question of choosing a home tutor is first and foremost, not a difficult thing to do.<br />
<br />
Yet we hear horror stories in the media of parents engaging a tutor that is well below par or simply put, the worst tutor they ever had.<br />
<br />
Why is that so? Let us explore some factors that goes into choosing a home tutor which will greatly help in the decision-making process.</span></p>

<p><span style=""color:#8e44ad""><strong>1. Cost</strong></span><br />
<span style=""color:#000000"">The cost of tuition definitely affects the type of tutor engaged. Tuition fees are dependent on several factors such as the tutor&rsquo;s qualifications, experience, duration and frequency of tuition.<br />
<br />
The higher the qualifications and experience, the higher the rates charged by each tutor. It is therefore more economical to choose a young student tutor or undergrad, especially if its for a lower level such as preschool, kindergarten or <u><a href=""https://tutorcity.sg/primary-school-tuition"">primary</a></u> 1-3.<br />
<br />
One important mistake that parents make is to always offer a slightly lower rate than the market rates. Any tutor who accept it might teach for a certain period of time but eventually will drop the assignment for a better-paying one. The performance during the tuition might be not as good as expected because the tutor feels shortchanged by the fees.<br />
<br />
We strongly advise parents to either pay according to market price or be a little more generous so as to bring out the best out of the tutor&rsquo;s abilities. Eventually, it is the best results that you want for your child and ultimately a brighter future.</span></p>

<p><span style=""color:#8e44ad""><strong>2. Experience of the tutor</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""color:#000000"">It is a common misconception that the better tutors are highly qualified and scored well academically. The more important criteria is the tutor&rsquo;s ability to teach and his past experience in the subjects he/she specialise in teaching.<br />
<br />
No doubt that academic grades reflects the tutor&rsquo;s knowledge in the subjects but someone who is able to score straight A&rsquo;s may not be able to teach another party. Good tutors are those who are able to make difficult concepts easy to understand.<br />
<br />
Each student has different absorption rates and capabilities, thus the tutor has to vary the teaching methods, tone of voice or choice of words for every student. An experienced tutor has an advantage because they have the exposure to many types of students and is able to vary their teaching style to suit each student.</span></p>

<p><span style=""color:#8e44ad""><strong>3. Interpersonal skills</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""color:#000000"">Clear and straightforward communication skills are key aspects of a good home tutor. The tutor must be able to communicate the subject&rsquo;s contents to the student and also be able to interact on a personal level with him/her.<br />
<br />
A tutor who wins their student&rsquo;s trust and respect will ensure a fruitful tuition experience. If the tutor is not able to communicate well e.g. being too quiet or monotonous tone of voice, the student eventually gets turned off and gets distracted during the tuition. The student may also fall asleep or start doing other things during the tuition e.g. SMS-ing, reading magazines.</span></p>

<p><span style=""color:#8e44ad"">4. Familiarity with latest MOE syllabus</span><br />
<br />
<span style=""color:#000000"">This is a double-edged sword: The more familiar a tutor is with the syllabus (i.e. school teachers / ex-school teachers), the higher his fees will be. They are the most familiar with the syllabus as they teach the subjects in their schools and are updated directly by MOE. Only go for this group of tutors if you can afford the fees they charge.<br />
<br />
But if you can&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t worry about it - we have many experienced tutors who have been giving tuition for many years and have helped students achieve distinctions and progress to top schools. This is because any changes to the syllabus does not greatly affect the abilities of home tutors as they already have the knowledge and experience to cope with it.</span></p>

<p><span style=""color:#8e44ad"">5. Location of tuition</span><br />
<br />
<span style=""color:#000000"">A shorter travelling time definitely results in punctuality and a more energetic tutor. If the tutor has to travel far, he/she will experience fatigue and distraction during the tuition. Tutor City will always provide tutors who are staying as close as possible to the student&rsquo;s place for convenience. Of course, if the tutor drives, then location shouldn&rsquo;t be too much of a problem.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, there are several factors to consider when getting a home tutor, getting them right from the start is critical to ensure that money is well-spent. Parents should always bear this in mind: your children&rsquo;s academic results is top priority. If you do not engage the correct tutors, it is not only a waste of money and time, but also delays to your children&rsquo;s improvement in their grades.</span></p>

<p><span style=""color:#000000""><strong>Tuition fees - How do tutors charge?</strong><br />
Rates vary according to the tutor category and the level of the students, and it is usually counted at an hourly rate. View our latest <u><a href=""https://tutorcity.sg/tuition-rates"">tuition rates.</a></u></span></p>","1","0000-00-00","2020-04-18 11:34:13"
"9","1","1","Tuition Scene in Singapore","tuition-scene-in-singapore",,,"1_to_1_Tuition_(small).jpg","<h2><strong><span style=""font-size:14px"">The tuition scene in Singapore has changed greatly since the 90s</span></strong></h2>

<p><span style=""color:#000000"">In Singapore, having tuition is part and parcel of almost every student&rsquo;s life. According to a Sunday Times poll in 2008, 97% of students in Singapore had some form of tuition, be it <u><a href=""https://tutorcity.sg"">home tuition</a></u>, tuition centres or student care centres. According to the Department of Statistics, the tuition industry is worth $820m in 2008, up from $470m in 1998.<br />
<br />
We shall look at the contributing factors on what drives the tuition industry to such heights, the recipients of tuition and the popularity of tuition centres and home tuition, at greater detail in this article.<br />
<br />
<strong>Who are the main recipients of tuition?</strong><br />
<br />
The majority of students are Primary school, followed by Secondary students and Junior College students. <u><a href=""https://tutorcity.sg/psle-tuition"">PSLE tuition</a></u>&nbsp;are the highest in demand due to the foundation-building needed to sit for the PSLE (Primary School Leaving Examinations), then its&nbsp;<u><a href=""https://tutorcity.sg/secondary-school-tuition"">secondary tuition</a></u> and <u><a href=""https://tutorcity.sg/jc-tuition"">JC tuition</a></u> are followed up close.<br />
<br />
We have also received requests for tuition in Kindergarten levels, foreign students needing&nbsp;<u><a href=""https://tutorcity.sg/aeis-tuition"">AEIS tuition</a></u>, <u><a href=""https://tutorcity.sg/ib-tuition"">IB tuition</a></u>, <u><a href=""https://tutorcity.sg/igcse-tuition"">IGCSE tuition</a></u>, Music, Computing, adult conversational languages and tertiary level.<br />
<br />
<strong>Why is tuition so popular in Singapore?</strong><br />
<br />
Parents in Singapore have hectic work schedules and often both parents have to go out to work, leaving little time and energy to coach their children.<br />
<br />
There are also subjects which parents find it difficult to teach as they themselves didn&rsquo;t study the subjects or is not familiar with the current syllabus.<br />
<br />
For foreign students, it is made even more difficult due to language differences, thus parents have to source for additional tuition after class to boost their child&rsquo;s language proficiency.<br />
<br />
<strong>Source of Tuition: Tuition Centres &amp; Home Tuition</strong><br />
<br />
The number of tuition centres has grown tremendously since the 1990s. Fees may range from $80 to more than $350 a month, some going by per subject basis or per class basis. Tuition is held in small groups at fixed timings, some as small as 3 students to big classes of 12 - 15 students.<br />
<br />
For home tuition, at any time there are thousands of tutors (10,000 &ndash; 30,000) in Singapore who offer home tuition. The charges normally range between $20 per hour to $120 per hour, depending on the qualifications and experience of the tutor.<br />
<br />
It is apparent that year on year, the number of tuition requests that Singapore <u><a href=""https://tutorcity.sg"">tuition agency</a></u> receive in-sync with the growth in the tuition industry.</span></p>

<p><span style=""color:#8e44ad""><em>First time getting a home tutor?</em><br />
<em>How much can I afford?</em><br />
<em>Comparing the rates from different tutors?</em></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""color:#000000"">Every parent will have to do budgeting on how much they can afford on <u><a href=""https://tutorcity.sg/tuition-rates"">tuition fees</a></u>, especially different subjects require more hours or additional tutors to be hired. Improper planning could see your wallet lightened considerably at the end of every month!<br />
<br />
Other than budgeting, an important consideration is should you spend more to get an experienced tutor? Or should you offer a low rate to engage a young tutor?<br />
<br />
What we suggest is that you cannot use price as the only factor, but the <strong>quality of tuition that brings you the desired results</strong>.<br />
<br />
Some pointers on your decision-making process:<br />
<br />
<strong>Rate per hour</strong><br />
<br />
The most common charging mechanism for tuition fees is the tutor&rsquo;s rate per hour.<br />
<br />
Each category of tutors charge a flat rate per hour to determine the final tuition fees. The higher the qualifications &amp; experience, the higher the hourly rate. Student tutors e.g. polytechnic students or undergraduates, offers the lowest rate due to their lesser experience.<br />
<br />
School teachers and retired school teachers charge the highest, often twice or thrice the rate of a normal home tutor.<br />
Somewhere in the middle would be part-time and full-time tutors who have completed their studies and have about 3 to 20 years of tutoring experience under their belts.<br />
<br />
<strong>Duration &amp; number of lessons per week</strong><br />
<br />
Each lesson normally lasts for 1.5 or 2 hours, which is adequate to cover 1 or 2 subjects in the same session. For 3 subjects or more, the 3<sup>rd</sup> subject has to be taught in a separate lesson.<br />
<br />
It is common to have 2 or 3 lessons a week, depending on how many subjects or how weak the child is in the subjects. There must be a sufficient break in-between the next lesson to allow the child to do homework and catch up with the rest of the syllabus.<br />
<br />
Having too many lessons in a week may result in fatigue and straining the child&rsquo;s social life, however some parents will increase the lessons just before the exam period.<br />
<br />
Shorter hours e.g. 45 mins or 1 hour, is normally for music lessons or Pre-school / Kindergarten levels as the attention span is lower than higher levels. For some tutors, they tend to decline tuition assignments with less than an hour as it is cost-inefficient in terms of time for the preparation and travelling.<br />
<br />
To get an estimate on tuition fees, for eg: Rate of $30 per hour, twice a week at 1.5 hours per lesson.<br />
<br />
Tuition Fees = $30 x 2 lessons x 1.5 hrs x 4 weeks = $360</span></p>

"13","2","1","Tutor Categories","tutor-categories",,,"tutor_categories.jpg","<h2><strong><span style=""font-size:14px"">What are the different Tutor Categories?</span></strong></h2>

<p><span style=""color:#000000"">Generally, there are 4 categories of home tutors in the Singapore market today:</span></p>

<p><span style=""color:#000000"">1. <strong>Polytechnic/JC/Undergraduate student tutors</strong><br />
<br />
As they are termed, student tutors are students who are still pursuing their education and therefore are able to relate to the academic stress and conditions your child is facing now since they are undergoing or had undergone the latest curriculum in their respective schools.<br />
<br />
Student tutors are most cost effective due to their lower charging rates and their schedule is very flexible as it depends on their own study timetable.<br />
<br />
Typically, most are comfortable in giving <u><a href=""https://tutorcity.sg/primary-school-tuition"">primary school tution</a></u> or <u><a href=""https://tutorcity.sg/secondary-school-tuition"">secondary school tuition</a></u> as they would have completed their education not too long ago.</span></p>

<p><span style=""color:#000000"">2. <strong>Part-time Tutors</strong><br />
<br />
Part-time tutors have full-time jobs during normal working hours, hence they are mostly available for tuition on evening and weekends.<br />
Part-time tutors are generally mature in age and will be able to share real-life working experience with the child. As part-time tutors have graduated and possess a certain level of tutoring experience, they command a slightly higher rate depending on the number of years they have been tutoring and the type of qualification.</span></p>

<p><span style=""color:#000000"">3. <strong>Full-Time Tutors</strong><br />
<br />
Full-time tutors provide tuition as their main bread-and-butter job, thus full-time tutors are able to teach during office hours which part-timers normally can&rsquo;t. The benefits which full-time tutors bring is the ability to identify weak areas faced by most children and provide the appropriate solutions.</span></p>

<p><span style=""color:#000000"">Full-time tutors are normally very familiar with the current syllabus as they tutor the same topics multiple times to different students. Due to their unique characteristics, full-time tutors charge a slightly higher premium over student and part-time tutors.<br />
<br />
Some are able to teach at higher levels such as <u><a href=""https://tutorcity.sg/a-level-tuition"">A-level tuition</a></u> and covering complex subjects such as <u><a href=""https://tutorcity.sg/gp-tuition"">GP tuition</a></u> and <u><a href=""https://tutorcity.sg/economics-tuition"">Economics tuition</a></u>.</span></p>

<p><span style=""color:#000000"">4. <strong>Ex-Teacher/Current Teacher</strong><br />
<br />
Teachers or ex-teachers are the most sought-after tutors in the local market.<br />
<br />
They have in-depth information about the changing trends of education in Singapore and some good teachers may even be able to spot potential questions that may appear in the exams.<br />
<br />
Ex-teachers and current teachers have been trained by the <u><a href=""https://www.nie.edu.sg"">National Institute of Education (NIE)</a></u>, therefore they have superior teaching and communication skills. Ex-teachers or current teachers command the highest rates (often over $50/per hour or higher), thus they may not be in the affordable budget range of most parents.<br />
<br />
In summary, choosing the right category of tutor for child depends on your specific needs and of course, the budget which you are able to spend on home tuition.</span></p>

<p><span style=""color:#000000""><strong>Is your kid playful and easily distracted?<br />
Does he/she hate the sight of assessment books?</strong><br />
<br />
One comforting thought is that - You are not alone!<br />
<br />
Countless parents all over the world are simply sick of nagging and punishing their children to study. For example, ff you wish to find ways to motivate your child to put in extra efforts in his&nbsp;<u><a href=""https://tutorcity.sg/chinese-tuition"">Chinese tuition</a></u> class, it&rsquo;s time to accept that the old school methods of using the &lsquo;stick&rsquo; don&rsquo;t work anymore.<br />
<br />
Motivating your child is a tough responsibility to bear. Repeated naggings about getting a good education and landing a good job 10 years later doesn&rsquo;t cut any ice with a kid who is already bogged down with a full day of schooling and feeling miserable from all the homework given. Asking him to do more assessment books will result in rebellion and frustration, as he cannot understand that the sweat put in then will result in a more comfortable life in future.<br />
<br />
The fact is that most children are not self-motivated and they will need motivation to get them to start learning. This is especially made difficult if the child is weak in the subjects and keeps failing test after test, which discourages them even more. Reaching the goal of scoring an A grade will prove even more difficult without help and coaching.<br />
<br />
<strong>What can a parent do in this case? Some suggestions we have:</strong><br />
<br />
1. </span><span style=""color:#8e44ad"">Short term goals</span><br />
<br />
<span style=""color:#000000"">If it is difficult to achieve big long-term targets e.g. distinction in PSLE, try setting short-term goals that are easy to achieve, such as improve from 50 to 70 marks in the next class test. Doing it step-by-step is better than nagging at the child on the importance of a long-term goal of say, achieving A1 in the <u><a href=""https://tutorcity.sg/o-level-tuition"">O level</a></u>.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Once your child taste the sweetness of success, the morale will be raised and the self-motivation factor kicks in. A child who is self-motivated and sets his own personal targets is likely to achieve them than one who is pushed or dragged along by his parents.<br />
<br />
2. </span><span style=""color:#8e44ad"">Words of encouragement, not words of scolding!</span><br />
<br />
<span style=""color:#000000"">Parents should use words of encouragement that will inspire their child, e.g. &ldquo;That was a good <u><a href=""https://tutorcity.sg/english-tuition"">English</a></u> composition you wrote!&rdquo; or &ldquo;You have remembered those formulas well&rdquo;. Make this a habit and use positive reinforcements so that your child&rsquo;s self-confidence in his / her abilities.<br />
<br />
3. </span><span style=""color:#8e44ad"">Rewards (&ldquo;carrots&rdquo;) works better than the &ldquo;stick&rdquo;.</span><br />
<br />
<span style=""color:#000000"">Whenever your child has done well, reward him generously (but don&rsquo;t over-indulge else you will spoil the child). Bring him to his favourite restaurant or buy a small gift. Knowing that his efforts are appreciated and recognised, and that they will be rewarded when his goals are achieved will incentivise him to work harder for the next goal.<br />
<br />
4. </span><span style=""color:#8e44ad"">Leading by example</span><br />
<br />
<span style=""color:#000000"">As a parent, you have to lead by example. You are the role model for him to follow and children pick things up from adults very quickly. If you have any bad habits, kick them before your child learns it. If you play video games while he is studying hard, then he will be distracted and thinks you are such an inconsiderate parent!<br />
<br />
Try to help out with their homework whenever you have the time. Spending an hour a day solving difficult <u><a href=""https://tutorcity.sg/maths-tuition"">singapore maths</a></u> questions, showing enthusiasm when he writes a new composition, will show the child that you care and behaves like a responsible parent.<br />
<br />
5. </span><span style=""color:#8e44ad"">Know his interests, his friends, his homework, everything!</span><br />
<br />
<span style=""color:#000000"">It pays to spend a few minutes chatting with him to know what are his interests in sport/music/games and the latest happenings in school. By understanding these aspects of your child&rsquo;s life, you will know what can motivate him better. If he does well, you will know how to reward him appropriately by getting him something he likes e.g. a new basketball rather than a soccer ball if your child prefers to play basketball. You will also be the first to know in the event of any changes to his school timetable or CCA&rsquo;s which affects his lifestyle and eventually his schoolwork.<br />
<br />
<strong>Conclusion</strong><br />
<br />
There are many parenting and motivational strategies as an alternative to scoldings or punishment. Positive reinforcements and encouragement will encourage growth and discipline in a child. Over time, once the child builds up his confidence and starts planning what he wants to achieve, your job as a parent is very much lightened. Your role will then be more of a mentor and provide guidance whenever he reaches an obstacle he cannot overcome on his own.</span></p>

Both parties have to listen to each other and share their views openly about how to conduct the tuition, especially if its <u><a href=""https://tutorcity.sg/university-tuition"">University tuition</a></u> or <u><a href=""https://tutorcity.sg/jc-tuition"">JC tuition</a></u> where the student is mature enough.&nbsp;E.g. if the lesson is too slow or fast, the student has to tell the tutor to moderate the pace of tuition. By communicating honestly, they will develop mutual respect to each other and hence this will allow the tutor to transfer his knowledge more effectively to the student.<br />
<br />
2. </span><span style=""color:#8e44ad""><em>Attentiveness</em></span><span style=""color:#000000""> &ndash; it is easy for the student to be distracted if the tuition is conducted after school and fatigue sets in. It is important to be attentive and listen to the tutor when he is explaining. The tutor has to understand and give a short break whenever he finds that the student appears to be dozing off. There is no point in persisting when the student is unable to absorb anymore.<br />
<br />
3. </span><span style=""color:#8e44ad""><em>Special requirements or topics</em> </span><span style=""color:#000000"">&ndash; the student should inform the tutor if there are any particular topics or focus on during the lesson. This will avoid the tutor teaching something that the student already is familiar or outside the required texts. The tutor can also prepare adequately before the lesson and make the learning process more effective for the student.<br />
<br />
4. </span><span style=""color:#8e44ad""><em>If the student don&rsquo;t understand, just say so</em>! </span><span style=""color:#000000"">Some students are plain shy when it comes to saying that they don&rsquo;t understand something for fear of reprisal or the tutor may comment &ldquo;This is so simple how can you still not understand?! This should be prevented as it will not help the student at all if they don&rsquo;t understand the solutions provided by the tutor. This is especially so in <a href=""https://tutorcity.sg/poa-tuition"">POA tuition</a> or <u><a href=""https://tutorcity.sg/physics-tuition"">Physics tuition</a></u> where there are many complex solutions and formulas.<br />
<br />
5. Likewise, the tutor should be </span><span style=""color:#8e44ad""><em>cooperative</em></span><span style=""color:#000000""><em> and not say disparaging remarks</em> when the student makes mistakes. The <u><a href=""https://tutorcity.sg"">home tutor singapore</a></u> should explain in different ways patiently to make the student understand. This will make the student more confident and encourage him to ask more questions and clear his doubts in a more effective manner.<br />
<br />
6. </span><span style=""color:#8e44ad""><em>Praises</em></span><span style=""color:#000000""><em> </em>should always be given to the student whenever he performs well or answers a difficult question correctly. &nbsp;This will definitely boost his self- confidence and motivates him to learn more challenging concepts.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, building a healthy relationship with the tutor is important in making each lesson productive and enjoyable for the student. It is a two-way process: when the student likes the way the tuition is conducted, the relationship will be improved. With a good tutor relationship, the lesson is interesting and learning will always be highly effective.</span></p>

<p><span style=""color:#000000"">In a traditional sense, a <u><a href=""https://tutorcity.sg"">tuition agency</a></u> is a middleman between tutors and parents or students. Simply to say, the agency obtains the parent&rsquo;s requirements such as subjects required, gender of tutor and budget.<br />
<br />
Tutors, on the other hand, register with the agency in order to get assignments based on their preferences such as subjects, location, timings and rates. Upon a suitable match, the agency will then coordinate the lesson timings and tie up the loose ends.<br />
<br />
<strong>How different are &lsquo;modern&rsquo; tuition agencies? Are they any different?</strong><br />
<br />
Yes of course!<br />
The proliferation of online tuition agencies changes the way parents and students seek for a suitable tutor.<br />
The &lsquo;brick-and-mortar&rsquo; tuition agency relying solely on phone calls is a thing of the past.<br />
<br />
Tutor City is an online tuition agency with the latest web capabilities and resources to provide our clients with the best tutor-search experience.<br />
<br />
Our <u><a href=""https://tutorcity.sg/search-tutors"">Search Tutors</a></u> function allow full view of our tutors&rsquo; profiles and short-list functionality (similar to online shops &lsquo;add-to-cart&rsquo; feature). This means our services are accessible 24 hours at any location.<br />
<br />
Being online means we can highlight outstanding tutors in our featured tutors panel on our homepage.<br />
<br />
We also provide a blog section with informative articles and resources for the benefit of everyone.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
We conduct regular feedback sessions with our clients on tutor&rsquo;s performance and these are recorded in our back-office system. Tutor City emphasize on quality tutoring services and tutors with negative feedback are black-listed in our records.<br />
<br />
Tutors can update their profiles at any time on our Tutor Login page.<br />
<br />
<strong>Why engage a tuition agency?</strong><br />
<br />
The task of searching, screening and replying to all the calls from potential tutors is tedious and time-consuming. After starting the lesson, parents find out from their child that the tutor is not suitable and have to go through the entire search process!</span></p>

<p><span style=""color:#000000"">The same can be said for the tutors &ndash; the lesson might be cancelled after 1 lesson due to some miscommunication of the initial requirements.<br />
<br />
This is where the tuition agency, such as Tutor City, acts as the single point of contact for the parents and tutors. Our extensive list of tutors is well-managed and segmented, making the search process a lot faster and accurate. Parents can get a suitable tutor within 1 hour to 24 hours from the time of <u><a href=""https://tutorcity.sg/request-tutor"">requesting a tutor</a></u>.<br />
<br />
<strong>What are the costs that parents or tutors have to pay?</strong><br />
<br />
For parents or students, most tuition agencies do not charge any fees for the matching services.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
For tutors, agencies normally charge 50% of the first month&rsquo;s tuition fees for each successful assignment. In the subsequent months, the tutor will collect the full tuition fees from the parents.</span></p>","1","0000-00-00","2020-05-31 10:43:15"

<p><span style=""color:#000000"">Grammar is an integral part of any language. Many parents strive to ensure that their children learn grammar quite well so that they can communicate well as they grow up. Furthermore, your child needs to be able to understand simple instructions and without proper grammar, he may end up doing almost the opposite of what you tell him or her. There is an even higher chance that he will have problems making friends because other children are bound to laugh at him if his or her English is full of grammatical errors.<br />
<br />
However, if your child has difficulties with this part of the language, there is a lot of hope for you. Below are effective ways that you can help your child improve his or her grammar:<br />
<br />
<strong>1. Invest in More Grammar Books</strong><br />
To improve your child&rsquo;s grammar, you also need to buy him or her enough grammar books. Remember, it is not just buying but ensure that he or she reads these books. You can even come up with a reading timetable for the kid so that he or she knows what to read at what time. These books with the help of a <u><a href=""https://tutorcity.sg"">tutor in Singapore</a></u> can help you child master not only grammar but other aspects of the English language.<br />
<br />
<strong>2. Play Word Games</strong><br />
Word games introduce your child to new vocabulary that is essential in his mastery of the language. However, as much as you want the child to learn from these games, make them fun and interesting rather than laborious. Otherwise, he or she may not be able to learn much. Grammar quizzes not only make some of the best games for your child to learn grammar but they <a href=""https://word-finder.com/articles/what-skills-do-word-games-teach/"" target=""_blank"">also teach what skills word games can develop</a>.<br />
<br />
<strong>3. Hire an English Tutor</strong><br />
You can help your child by getting an <u><a href=""https://tutorcity.sg/english-tuition"">English tutor</a></u> to help him or her catch up. Tutors have been known to turn around even the most difficult of students. A home tutor will help your child learn a lot more than what a classroom teacher offers. These professionals are trained to guide the child master the language right from the basics. Furthermore, <a href=""https://tutorcity.sg/english-tuition"">English tuition</a> is very effective at this since the child is getting private lessons and will certainly ask the tutor anything he or she may have been afraid to ask in a normal classroom setting. When he/she reaches JC, <a href=""https://tutorcity.sg/gp-tuition"">GP tuition</a> might be a necessity if there is no strong foundation in English langauge.<br />
<br />
<strong>Conclusion</strong><br />
<br />
Getting your child to work on grammar is not that difficult. As long as you have provided a favourable learning atmosphere at home and also enlist the services of a <a href=""https://tutorcity.sg"">home tutor</a>, then you should expect to see a lot of changes quite soon. Doing this for your child is one of the greatest gifts you can give him or her. This is because, he or she will grow up full of confidence because he can speak before anyone without fear of being ridiculed or laughed at because of poor grammar</span></p>","1","0000-00-00","2023-02-10 15:09:30"

<p><span style=""color:#000000"">Families tend to approach private tuition either by informal means such as hiring a private tutor that cater to a student&rsquo;s individual schooling needs or with customized remedial lessons. Often, they hire a <a href=""https://tutorcity.sg"">private tutor</a> by word of mouth or by ads pasted on internet message boards. For a more former approach, they may enroll their child in one of the large numbers of tutoring centers in Singapore.<br />
<br />
In most western countries, sending a child for <u><a href=""https://tutorcity.sg"">private tuition</a></u> used to be traditionally associated with a student in danger of failing a subject. However, in Singapore, it is now the norm to begin from&nbsp;<u><a href=""https://tutorcity.sg/primary-school-tuition"">Primary School tuition</a></u>&nbsp;usually from Primary-Level third or fourth (around age 9-10) for additional tutoring to build literacy and math skills.<br />
<br />
The low age level at which children begin private tuition in Singapore and the anecdotal evidence that most children receive private tuition till the <u><a href=""https://tutorcity.sg/o-level-tuition"">GCE O&rsquo; Levels</a> </u>likely indicates two different trends: first, that parents themselves feel that there is increasing competitiveness in Singapore&rsquo;s education system and second, parents may be experiencing dissatisfaction with the way their children are taught in school.<br />
<br />
<strong>The role of the private tutor</strong><br />
<br />
Private tuition can be seen as a way of allowing a trained professional to focus on students by approaching them as individuals, in contrast to the approach taken by schools, which has more focus on the aims and objectives of working to enhance the skills and capacity of students as a group. Personalized learning offer an opportunity for <a href=""https://tutorcity.sg"">private tutors</a> to open up a dialogue with both the parents and students and to see how they may better accommodate their clients&rsquo; needs.<br />
<br />
But just exactly does this work? The typical aim and process undertaken by a private tutor will be to identify the exact kind of extra help required to overcome barriers to learning and building on existing arrangements (usually by the school) already in place. This allows private tutors to devote the majority of their time with the student to providing the extra support to realize their full potential.<br />
<br />
<strong>The problems of using an outcome-oriented process</strong><br />
<br />
It is fairly safe to say that examination grades are the de-facto &ldquo;KPI&rdquo; targets by which to judge the cost-effectiveness of tuition agencies and individuals; in a country where much of our life revolves around earning and spending money, parents would try to maximize the most output from their hard-earned dollars. For example, the publication of their student&rsquo;s results is a common approach that private tutors and agencies have recently been using to rationalize the effectiveness of the extra education that they provide. For international students, there is another aspect in the <a href=""https://tutorcity.sg/ib-tuition"">IB diploma</a> that puts community service as a compulsory subject, shifting the focus away from academic success.<br />
<br />
There are significant problems associated with this outcome-oriented approach to private tuition - other key aspects of the private tuition process gets ignored and downplayed, such as engaging the child to develop self-confidence and individual esteem. The &ldquo;soft&rsquo; aspects of the educational encounters cannot be captured within a focus of solely on exam grades - Shy children may learn to speak up and develop their self-confidence through engaging with an effective and encouraging tuition teacher, as they would have opportunities to engage in conversation and dialogue in a setting that otherwise may be unavailable to them in school. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
This is even more particularly important with the recent shift in focus to place more emphasis on &ldquo;deep skills&rdquo;, with a clear approach by manpower planning and education authorities to prepare and transform young Singaporeans into knowledge workers that can be plugged into a globalized economy.<br />
<br />
The concentration on achieving the particular outcome of attaining good grades can easily encourage students and tuitions teachers alike being assessed on a narrow range - rather than on any contribution made to the quality of personal flourishing or social-skills development that arise out of the process of informal private tuition.<br />
<br />
Given the relatively recent changes in our nation&rsquo;s university education of taking on a more multi-disciplinary approach, where university students of all disciplines are expected to have more exposure to &ldquo;soft subjects&rdquo; such as the humanities or social sciences, maintaining a purely outcome-oriented approach to academic excellence may not be a viable option for young students in Singapore.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, while some enlightened parents may be open to some sort of alternative outcomes, given my own personal experiences and from stories from friends elsewhere, it is still likely the focus will be on matters like attendance, qualification and upon other indicators, most notably formal attainment of improving grades.<br />
<br />
<strong>Does private tuition really make a difference?</strong><br />
<br />
As such, there is a question here to ponder upon: Can private tuition really make a difference? How much does <u><a href=""https://tutorcity.sg/tuition-rates"">tuition cost</a></u> these days?<br />
<br />
Social pressures being what it is in an ultra-competitive economic landscape such as Singapore, and with the additional pressures of the ever-changing nature of a knowledge economy, where certain jobs and occupations are phased out and lost forever due to advances in technology, there is a tendency within not just our society but world-wide, for individuals and families with the extra cash, to spend it on accumulating additional resources and resources for their offspring, and adapt it to fit their particular needs.<br />
<br />
Educational equality (or rather, the inequality of it) is an important issue for our contemporary <u><a href=""https://tutorcity.sg/social-studies-tuition"">Singaporean society</a></u>. If we are to have a constantly-developing and sustainable society, it is important to ensure that all children have equal access to education. It can happen in various ways and it can occur without at the expense of the public educational system.<br />
<br />
This might sound obvious and reasonable to anyone involved in the educational system, be it parents, teachers, private tutors or students themselves. However, in reality, due to a series of problems, on many levels, it is far harder to achieve in practice than we might expect. Thus, private tuition is a symptom of market forces trying to address the perceived aspects of this over the years through providing alternative pipelines of access and equality.<br />
<br />
However, the really big question for us today is whether private education itself is a reflection of the inequalities, if any, of our society, and whether it is possible to question the assumptions of (and if need be, to challenge) such inequalities, reducing the impact of social pressure on educational outcomes overall. If this could be achieved, then it would lead to a more sustainable private tuition industry.<br />
<br />
<strong>The relationship between streaming and tuition</strong><br />
<br />
If the average Singaporean student wants to do well in our current education system, it is probably best to be born not just in the middle-class, but to have one or more parent that is a degree or diploma holder. The fact that streaming in our educational system can happen early on in a child&rsquo;s school career, often on the basis of examination grades, indicate that children that are school focused have already been receiving prior and better levels of educational support from their families than other groups of children.<br />
<br />
This is because their parents, having gone through the processes of the educational system themselves, already have a good understanding of what is required of their offspring at school and in the PSLE and GCE &lsquo;O&rdquo; Level examination process. They tend to have access to greater amounts of disposable income, which allows them to pay for outside education, tutoring or private coaching if necessary. &nbsp;Such children are far more likely to do well in Singapore&rsquo;s education system than any other group and are also likely to be encouraged to take part in a greater number of extra-curricular activities. Such parents also tend to be more skilled navigators of Primary and Secondary Schools&rsquo; admissions processes, which means that they have a higher probability of attaining highly-coveted slots for their children at the popular schools.<br />
<br />
Another issue to consider is whether such differences in education performances will result in a situation where the student&rsquo;s educational outcomes is already pre-determined (statistically speaking), by the education stream they are in and if this will also affect their choice of jobs and careers.<br />
<br />
Interestingly, while the educational system gradually and systematically classify pupils via relying on information such as the student&rsquo;s grades, it is far from clear if there are any effects at all on how these students subsequently perform later on in the upper levels of the educational system.<br />
<br />
<strong>Turning from Tuition Teachers to Learning Mentors</strong><br />
<br />
Given that most adults in the modern Singaporeans households tend to be working and holding jobs, parents are far less able to be as &ldquo;hands-on&rdquo; as those of early generations, and would have to transfer or &ldquo;offload&rdquo; part of their educational oversight in the hands of trained professionals for their children&rsquo;s early education, especially in mathematics and literacy skills. Since tutoring centers and private tutors are seen as the supplementary provider of knowledge for students to passing exams, (whether these are PSLE or GCE &ldquo;O&rdquo; Level Exams), especially for getting into prestigious institutions, parents will always employ the services of private tutors.<br />
<br />
In this sense, private tutors and tutoring centers do contribute to the educational success of Singaporean students.<br />
<br />
Private tutors, are in this sense, can be seen as &ldquo;Learning Mentors&rdquo;, and they can attain certain outcomes, such as the following:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Raise standards and to help parents and students alike to make accelerated progress in achieving their targets;<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provide a complementary service to existing schools teachers;<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ensure, through the provision of professionally trained tutors, that every student will have access to a new resource focused on removing barriers to the student&rsquo;s individual learning both in school and outside;<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Focus targeted and selective help on those who need it most in the weakest areas<br />
<br />
It is important that we urgently develop a solid basis for understanding the hidden processes underpinning all this, in order to build up our society&rsquo;s cultural and intellectual capital. &nbsp;</span></p>","1","0000-00-00","2020-05-06 20:28:01"

<p><span style=""color:#000000"">Theory of knowledge is a subject that is very broad based and can take information from any other academic subject on an ad hoc basis. Precisely what students need to learn, and the areas that information is obtained from, will depend on the issues being discussed in class. Students are then best advised to research the topics their essays are based on. Topics such as should smoking be banned, is terrorism wrong, and does the state have the right to censor it&#39;s citizens, could be discussed. The objective of TOK is to get students thinking about topics and then gain knowledge to develop their opinions further.</span></p>

<p><span style=""color:#8e44ad"">How to score in TOK?</span><br />
<br />
<span style=""color:#000000"">What exactly someone needs to include in a theory of knowledge (TOK) essay can depend on which country they are studying their international baccalaureate. Theoretically of course there should be no difference in the content of the subject, just in the way students want to write their essay and make it different from everyone else&#39;s work. Yet this subject is a study of the ideas that underpin the concept of knowledge.<br />
<br />
The <u><a href=""https://tutorcity.sg/ib-tuition"">international baccalaureate</a></u> diploma is exactly as it&#39;s title suggest, a globally recognized academic qualification. For students in Singapore, gaining the diploma is a means of obtaining a qualification that will be useful if they decide to do further studies, or seek paid employment abroad. The curriculum gives Singapore students a chance to learn the same things as fellow students in every other country.</span></p>

<p><span style=""color:#8e44ad"">TOK can be difficult to manage for some students</span><br />
<br />
<span style=""color:#000000"">Theory of knowledge is not like other academic subjects in that students are actively encouraged to share their opinions instead of merely quoting a seemingly endless run of facts. Facts and figures can be used but they are only needed in enough quantity to support any of the points being made in the essay. Students can also draw on knowledge gained from a whole host of different subjects, as long as they clarify the links between often diverse factors. As a course, TOK can cover just about anything as it has very broad limits. When writing a TOK essay, students can use any relevant facts and figures to support their lines of argument provided it is used within context and fits in with the overall gist of the essay itself.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, TOK is unlike other subjects; whether or not at IB diploma level does not ever argue that there is a right or a wrong answer to the question posed by the essay title itself. Students have to write a rational response to the essay title, and then come up with ways to come to back up, or to justify their case throughout the essay from its introduction, through to its conclusion.<br />
<br />
The arguments and supporting facts need to precisely stated as essays that are too long in length will lose marks. There is not enough word count to include facts and figures in copious amounts so students should keep it brief. Being able to impart extra meaning into fewer words is useful here. Words have to be used wisely plus students not only need to argue in support of their opinions they have to give their arguments their own original twist to make each essay unique to them alone.<br />
<br />
Students writing a TOK essay need to organize it in such a way to maximize their final markings for each submitted piece of work. To begin with students are able to choose the essay title that they will write about. Then they need to decide how they will approach writing their essay, whether they support the statement, or indeed oppose it. Overall the key is to concisely put forward both sides of the argument prior to drawing conclusions.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style=""color:#000000"">In case, should some problems occur, there are many reputable essay <a href=""https://academichelp.net/top-lists/websites-that-write-essays-for-you-top-10-services.html"" target=""_blank"">sites</a>, that provide educational resources and guidance on how to write a TOK essay, and help to structure the essay in a way that maximizes the final markings.<br />
<br />
Finally, some students may benefit from using the services of a home tutor to improve the quality of their TOK essay. Generally if a student is effective at gathering information and then reusing knowledge to make concise arguments on their own, they will not need extra tutoring. On the other hand if they are not capable of writing convincing arguments then home tutors will help student on how to plan and write an effective TOK essay. Some might engage an <u><a href=""https://tutorcity.sg/english-tuition"">English home tutor</a></u> to boost their command of the language side by side with the TOK tutor.</span></p>","1","0000-00-00","2023-06-29 11:46:46"

The child may be struggling with a difficult curriculum, or they may have simply lost the motivation to learn. </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">These and other reasons can have a detrimental effect on the child&rsquo;s grades and spoil their chances to achieve success in the future. </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">Of course, grades are not the only thing that helps us measure a child&rsquo;s intelligence, but when it comes to enrolling in a good university, they are essential. So to prevent bad grades and <strong>motivate</strong> their children to study harder, parents turn to <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/request-tutor"" target=""_blank"">private tutors</a>. </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">If you have found yourself in this situation, you may want to consider the pros and cons of private tuition. Only by examining all the advantages and disadvantages of private tutoring will you be able to ascertain whether it is worth your money. </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""color:#f39c12""><strong><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">The Advantages of Private Tutoring</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">So let&rsquo;s start by listing some of the main advantages your child will get by working with a private tutor. </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">1. Customized approach. </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">On average, classrooms contain a few dozen students. On the one hand, larger class-size helps us cut the cost of education, but on the other hand, it is far less beneficial for children to learn in such environment. </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><strong>Various studies and reviews have proven that smaller class sizes are more beneficial for students.</strong> In larger classes, teachers follow a predetermined pace and are mostly focused on finishing the syllabus for the academic year. As a result, they are unable to address the individual needs of each student. </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">Each human being is unique; some learn quicker than others. Some students may need additional explanation. A private tutor <strong>customizes the approach according to your child&rsquo;s needs</strong>. If they notice that the child hasn&rsquo;t understood something, they will not move on to the next topic just because they are under time pressure. </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">2. There are almost no distractions. </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">Children have a notoriously short attention span anyway, and when they are sitting in a crowded classroom next to their best friend, they are guaranteed to get distracted from the topic. </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">By contrast, <strong>private tutoring usually occurs in a peaceful setting</strong>. In a quiet room where there are virtually no distractions, tutors can give their students their full attention, and students have no other choice than to focus on what their tutor is saying. </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">3. Working with a tutor improves confidence and self-esteem. </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">Shy students usually become more confident in their knowledge once they have worked with a private tutor. Teachers at school usually do not have time to <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/blog/positive-psychology-and-its-benefits"" target=""_blank"">offer continuous positive reinforcement</a> to each student. By offering such reinforcement tutors help their students to come out of their shell and become more active not only during tutoring sessions but in school as well.</span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">4. Tutoring improves performance at school. </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">Children who work with a private tutor are able to process information at their own pace. Tutoring also improves the child&rsquo;s <strong>intrinsic motivation.</strong> </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">In addition, the children who work with a tutor have a higher level of self-esteem, so they are more likely to be active during class and less afraid of making mistakes in front of their peers. These and other factors may help the child to achieve better grades at school. </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">5. Going beyond the syllabus material. </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">The material offered by the syllabus is just a bare minimum your child needs to be successful and competitive in life. The tutor will not only help your child master the material contained in the syllabus, but they will also provide <strong>additional material</strong> that is related to the syllabus but may not be covered in it. </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">By doing this, they can increase the child&rsquo;s interest in the given subject and even show them how to apply their knowledge in real-life situations. </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""color:#f39c12""><strong><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">Disadvantages of Private Tutoring</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">1. Cost. </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">When asked about the disadvantages of private tutoring, high <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/tuition-rates"" target=""_blank"">tuition cost</a> is the first thing that comes to mind. Hiring an experienced and highly qualified private tutor can be quite expensive, and many families may not be able to afford it. </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">2. A particular tutor may not be a good match for your child. </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">It isn&rsquo;t enough for a tutor to be highly qualified; they also should be able to <strong>earn your child&rsquo;s trust</strong>. Studies have shown that children achieve better results when they can relate to their tutors. If the tutor&rsquo;s personality or their methodology is unacceptable to the child, it can be counterproductive. </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">Your child may experience a sense of protest towards the tutor, which may lead them to dislike the subject altogether. If you noticed that your child shows <strong>resentment</strong> towards the tutor, it is necessary to address this problem to prevent them from rebelling against the subject. </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">3. Not all tutors are good teachers. </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">Unfortunately, many parents believe that if they hire somebody who has a degree in a specific subject, this will automatically result in good tutoring. <strong>Teaching is a skill</strong>, and having a degree in a particular subject is not a guarantee that one possesses that skill. Tutors who lack teaching skills may further demotivate your child with their boring lessons. </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">4. Safety concerns. </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">Many parents are not comfortable with the idea of leaving their child alone with an adult they do not know well. To avoid any negative incidents from occurring, it is always recommended to look for private tutors through a <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/"" target=""_blank"">professional tuition agency</a> that thoroughly vets their tutors. </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">In addition, you can request a criminal background report from your potential tutor or ask them to provide recommendations from their former students. Even after all of that, you may want to keep an eye on them just to be safe. </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">5. Less time for other activities. </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">Tutoring may take up a lot of time, especially if the child works with several different tutors and has to travel to different locations. Therefore,<strong> tutoring can take up time the child</strong> could otherwise spend on doing homework or participating in some extracurricular activities. Children who work with private tutors also have far less time to engage with family and friends or simply relax.</span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">These are some of the <strong>benefits and disadvantages&nbsp;of private tutoring</strong>. In the end, it is up to you to decide whether it is something that is worth your child&rsquo;s time and your money.

<p><span style=""color:#000000""><strong><em>Singapore is a land of dreams.</em></strong><br />
A lot of people all across the world come to Singapore to work and provide a better lifestyle to their families. Singapore&rsquo;s population consists of about 40% of foreigners including PRs and people residing in the country to make a living. With the influx of so many people coming from different countries and being a business hub, English has become the most spoken language here in Singapore not only in the workplace but also in schools and homes. While English is considered the global language and it is essential for everyone to learn to communicate with people from all around the world, it is also necessary to know one&rsquo;s mother tongue. In fact, one should not only learn their mother tongue but learn as many languages as possible.<br />
<br />
In Singapore, English is taught as the first language and students need to learn their mother tongue as the second language which could be either Chinese, Malay or Tamil. This helps the students stay connected to their roots as well as be prepared for global or regional opportunities in the future. With about 50% of the population in Singapore belonging to the Chinese ethnic group, Chinese is the next most spoken language in Singapore.<br />
<br />
Chinese is considered one of the most difficult and complex languages to learn. Speaking the language doesn&rsquo;t mean it would help you learn reading or writing it. It consists of over 100,000 characters but to read a newspaper an individual needs to know only about 3000-4000 of these characters. Apart from the characters, there are four tones of pronunciation which means each word can be pronounced in four different ways, and each pronunciation has a different meaning. All this could be quite intimidating for someone who is learning the language and would require professional help to understand and practice it. Hence, there has been a rise in Chinese tuition in Singapore.</span></p>

<p><span style=""color:#8e44ad""><strong>LEVELS OF LEARNERS</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""color:#000000"">Here in Singapore, Chinese is learned in schools, colleges, as well as business professionals learn the basic business level Chinese. To gain more proficiency and master the language there is a high dependency on Chinese tuition. Below are the different levels of Chinese learners:<br />
<br />
<strong>Mother Tongue Language (MTL)</strong>: Chinese is one of the second languages taught in schools from the <a href=""https://tutorcity.sg/primary-school-tuition"">Primary</a> onwards under the Mother Tongue Language Policy by the Ministry of Education. Students need to score really well in their <a href=""https://tutorcity.sg/psle-tuition"">Primary School Leaving Exam (PSLE)</a> to get admission to elite schools for their secondary level. And after their secondary schooling is completed they need good scores in GCE &#39;O&#39; Level exam. This will determine their admission to premium to pre-university education institutes. And after the GCE &lsquo;A&rsquo; Level examination they move to the university. At all these levels they need to make sure they score well in Chinese as well.<br />
<br />
<strong>Higher Mother Tongue (HMT)</strong>: Some of the eligible students opt to take up an additional and optional examinable subject to get more in-depth and gain a higher proficiency in their respective mother tongues. These students then get an option to opt-out of mother tongue classes in pre-university if they have cleared their HMT exams at <a href=""https://tutorcity.sg/secondary-school-tuition"">Secondary level</a>. The level of the language taught is more difficult and helps students to develop their Chinese language skills further.<br />
<br />
<strong>Business Level</strong>: Singapore is a business hub and is considered a link between the rest of the world and Asia for smooth operations as Singapore has both English and Chinese speaking population. China is one of the biggest manufactures in the world and is a major economic power. To build your ties with the Chinese companies its very important to understand and communicate with them in Chinese. Companies all around are hiring individuals who can communicate well in Chinese. To leverage this competitive advantage that Singapore has, people here are making an effort to learn at least business level Chinese.</span></p>

<p><span style=""color:#8e44ad""><strong>MODES OF LEARNING</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""color:#000000"">Chinese tuition have a big presence in Singapore. Apart from schools and colleges, students rely on tuition to get a better hold of the subject. These <a href=""https://tutorcity.sg/"">tuition agencies</a> provide both private 1 on 1 tuition as well as group tuition at the tuition centers.<br />
<br />
Private Chinese tuition allow the teachers to plan the lessons based on the learner&#39;s level and need. They are more personalized in terms of the speed of teaching, the lesson planning as well as offer flexible timing as per the individual&rsquo;s schedule. They do work out to be more expensive as compared to group tuition but are more effective.<br />
<br />
Group Chinese tuition, on the other hand, are good for the students to practice conversation skills. They can converse amongst themselves in Chinese as well as with the teacher. It also helps to bring out the competitive spirit which in turn helps the students to make more effort in learning the language. One of the major drawbacks of group Chinese tuition is that classes are scheduled at fixed time slots and can not be changed as per an individual&rsquo;s schedule. Also as the teacher-student ratio is more individual attention could be a miss.</span></p>

<p><span style=""color:#8e44ad""><strong>WHY IS THERE A NEED?</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""color:#000000""><strong>Practice Conversation Skills</strong>: Practice makes a man perfect. It&#39;s very difficult to master Chinese if you don&rsquo;t speak it often. With Chinese tuition, individuals get a chance to practice their Chinese conversation skills and are also corrected immediately if they make any mistakes.<br />
<br />
<strong>Holistic Learning</strong>: During the Chinese tuition class, the students are not only taught how to speak but also read and write Chinese. This ensures holistic learning and prepares the students for any future prospects that demand the Chinese language.<br />
<br />
<strong>Innovative Teaching Techniques</strong>: In schools and colleges the Chinese curriculum and process of teaching are generally set with every limited scope of alterations. Experienced Chinese tutors would make the curriculum as per the student&rsquo;s needs. They have some unique and innovative teaching techniques to make sure the learning sticks with the learners and alter as per an individual&rsquo;s requirements. They make sure it helps the students connect with the language rather than being just a subject that they have to learn.<br />
<br />
<strong>Boost Confidence</strong>: As Chinese is a difficult language to master, a lot of students have a mind-block about the same which makes it even more difficult to pick up the language. With that, it builds a lot of pressure on the student. Chinese tuition would help the students boost their confidence as it makes learning simpler and more individual attention is given.<br />
<br />

It is well known for its very efficient approach that focuses on mastering math while being more engaging as well.&nbsp;<br />
This could not be more apparent in the way it is taught by rendering an abstract subject like math into something more concrete. Normally, this is done through the application of math in real-life situations, which a lot of experts can attest does very well to encourage the appreciation of math among most people.&nbsp;<br />
The app we recommend above is a very good representative of everything that is good about Singapore math. It immerses your child in various interactive scenarios that are interwoven with various math concepts and problems. The app uses familiar and kid-friendly imagery of everyday objects and various animals to complement its unique teaching approach.</span><br />
<br />
<u><strong><a href=""https://www.prodigygame.com/""><span style=""color:#2980b9"">Prodigy Game</span></a></strong></u><br />
<span style=""color:#000000"">For your child who is learning grade 1-8 math, this app is definitely recommended for the sole reason that teachers worldwide heartily recommend it as well. True to its name, it helps children learn math with the seamless incorporation of games. The app is very versatile, to say the least,&nbsp; because it manages to provide engaging content for students in various grade levels. The same goes for the major topics, which include Measurement, Numeration, Geometry, Algebra, Probability, to cite a few.&nbsp;<br />
All in all, we can safely say that once you get this app, you need not look further for a maths app that can deliver everything you and your child&rsquo;s learning tools.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2 dir=""ltr""><span style=""color:#000000"">Maths Books</span></h2>

<p dir=""ltr""><span style=""color:#000000"">Books can never be replaced as a learning reference simply because of their easy accessibility. Also, a lot of people (kids included) prefer to stare at an actual page than at a digital one. While they may lack the interactivity factor of apps, they still manage to exclusive knowledge and insights that can be crucial to your child&rsquo;s improvement.&nbsp;<br />
Undoubtedly, they also manage to engage their readers with their use of storytelling. Below are the three best math books for preschoolers and those in grades 1-8 that superbly exhibit these qualities.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<u><strong><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34002095-baby-goes-to-market""><span style=""color:#2980b9"">Baby Goes to Market</span></a></strong></u><br />
<span style=""color:#000000"">Smooth in its inclusion of basic math concepts in a setting as realistic and every day as a trip to the marketplace, this book combines excellent narrative with numbers (specifically basic counting and even <u><a href=""https://tutorcity.sg/economics-tuition"">economics</a></u>). It even goes further by providing insights into society, which can definitely immerse your child in this essential part of his future life.&nbsp;<br />
Ultimately, its value lies in the way it is able to show your child the value of math in daily life. Along with the great illustrations, the book definitely gives your child the right introduction to math that some schools might not readily teach.</span><br />
<br />
<u><strong><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33154778-a-hundred-billion-trillion-stars""><span style=""color:#2980b9"">A Hundred Billion Trillion Stars</span></a></strong></u><br />
<span style=""color:#000000"">What could better stimulate the mind of your child than the cosmos? This book is recommended for children in grades 3-5 but even kids past that age will surely find it extra memorable. It does well to lay and highlight the immense figures normally associated with something as vast as the universe. Thrown in are random bits of trivia that even adults will find highly captivating.&nbsp;<br />
But, in the end, it is really the research that the author put into the book regarding the large numbers and statistics pertaining to the cosmos. Again, this book is something we recommend for its demonstration of the practical uses of <u><a href=""https://tutorcity.sg/maths-tuition"">maths</a></u> in <u><a href=""https://tutorcity.sg/science-tuition"">science</a></u> and our world. These are sure to instill a love for math and a sense of wonder in your child for numerical facts about the universe.</span><br />
<br />
<u><strong><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22858940-really-big-numbers""><span style=""color:#2980b9"">Really Big Numbers</span></a></strong></u><br />
<span style=""color:#000000"">This book is unique in its approach not only because it mixes narration with math problems and deep dive into the world of numbers. Rather, it is able to stand apart because it is one of the books that can safely say that it is able to improve and enrich the reader with every turn of the page.&nbsp;<br />
It is this wholly different learning experience that makes it a good book to get for a child in grades 6-8. Questions are asked on every math topic it explores, which only serve to challenge and stimulate the reader&rsquo;s mind long after he has put it down.</span></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">&nbsp;</p>

<h2 dir=""ltr""><span style=""color:#000000"">Other Ways to Enrich Your Child&rsquo;s Passion for Mathematics</span></h2>

<p dir=""ltr""><strong><span style=""color:#000000"">Develop a math dictionary</span></strong><br />
<span style=""color:#000000"">The words &ldquo;dictionary&rdquo; and &ldquo;math&rdquo; may not readily mix for most people, but a lot have found that making a math dictionary actually works wonders. The more your child advances, the more terms and techniques he has to memorize, which can be as challenging as solving actual problems. Having a dictionary on hand not only makes it easy to keep track of these terms, but give him an organized overview of all the topics he needs to master.&nbsp;<br />
List down every terminology along with its specific definition, accompanied by sample questions and answers so your child will always be able to have a ready reference. Think of creative ways to do this (you can even use regular flashcards).&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style=""color:#000000"">Use technology to the fullest</span></strong><br />
<span style=""color:#000000"">Apps are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the techy platforms you can rely on. There are tools like </span><u><a href=""https://www.wolframalpha.com/""><span style=""color:#2980b9"">Wolfram Alpha</span></a></u><span style=""color:#000000"">, for instance, not only help your child get the answer directly but provides step-by-step guidelines on how it arrived at those. The second feature is undoubtedly what makes these tools valuable to the student.&nbsp;<br />
Another good example is </span><u><a href=""https://www.symbolab.com/""><span style=""color:#2980b9"">Symbolab</span></a></u><span style=""color:#000000"">. They basically serve as the best alternative to an actual teacher because of these capabilities.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style=""color:#000000"">Don&rsquo;t forget to pay attention to your child&rsquo;s learning environment</span></strong><br />
<span style=""color:#000000"">Most parents overlook the study environment that their child is learning in, which definitely should be corrected because this factor is just as important. The study area should be free from noise and distractions for your child to achieve maximum concentration conducive to learning and solving more complex math problems.<br />
Study music may not have much scientific proof to back it up, but some people do manage to focus better when music playing in the background. Those without lyrics are often recommended for obvious reasons, particularly most types of classical music. Generally, music that helps your child relax is good as well. And it will be wise to make a playlist out of them so you can play them anytime.&nbsp;</span></p>

It defines the dynamics of earth and nature, the fundamentals of technology and the concepts of space, time, matter and energy. The study of physics is without a doubt of high relevance in today&rsquo;s society.<br />
<br />
It not only helps to understand our existence but also helps provide solutions for mankind to survive for years to come. Physics has made our lives much simpler with technology that we so extensively use day in and day out. It is everywhere and helps contribute to the other disciplines as well, such as the earth, agriculture, astrophysics, cosmology, chemical, biological, IT and medical applications.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"">In Singapore, Physics is introduced at O-Level starting from secondary 3, teaching the students the basics like energy, matter, and their correlation. It could be one of the most intimidating subjects for many if the basics are not clear right at the beginning as it has a lot of technical jargon and symbols.<br />
<br />
The subject demands an inquisitive mind, a deep understanding of the concepts, technical application and also good mathematical skills. We have compiled a list of handy tricks that are sure to help you master Physics as well as give your grades a jump-start.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><strong><span style=""font-size:14.0pt"">Tricks to help you master Physics and improve your grades</span></strong></span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><strong>Master your physics basics</strong></span></span><br />
	<span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"">To begin with, you need to master the basics of Physics and have a very clear understanding of all the concepts, theories, principles and laws of Physics. If the foundation is set it would automatically generate interest and liking for the subject and also make it very easy to grasp the subject as the difficulty level increases.</span></span></span><br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><strong>Dedicate time to practice</strong></span></span><br />
	<span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"">Practice makes a man perfect. Make sure you set aside at least half an hour every day to practice and go through what you have learned in class as well as in your tuitions, even if you have understood the topic well. This would help reinforce and remember the concepts. Memorizing the concepts won&#39;t help in Physics. If you want to excel you need to understand, practice and apply it, just like mathematics.</span></span></span><br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><strong>Make notes and use drawings</strong></span></span><br />
	<span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"">We would suggest you always make your own notes during self-study. Try and have a graphical representation of the concepts as much as possible. Writing and the use of drawings would help you process the information faster and retain it. Also, it would make it easier for you to prepare and revise for your exams.&nbsp;</span></span></span><br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><strong>Read up before class</strong></span></span><br />
	<span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"">Reading up the topic before your class is a good practice as it would help you comprehend it better. By doing so, you would gain some familiarity with the topic which would make it easier for you to follow your teacher during the class. You can also make a list of your questions and pay more attention to those topics in the class. In case you still need more clarity you can easily get them clarified during the class itself.</span></span></span><br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><strong>Be patient and have an open mind</strong></span></span><br />
	<span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"">Let&#39;s face the fact that Physics is a complex subject. There would be some topics you would understand immediately while some that you won&rsquo;t get at first. Don&rsquo;t be harsh on yourself. Remember, Rome wasn&rsquo;t built in a day. Keep an open mind and keep practicing. Patience and persistence would help you master this complex but wonderful subject.</span></span></span><br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><strong>Use of additional learning aids</strong></span></span><br />
	<span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"">Don&rsquo;t restrict your learning only through the course books. Use as many other mediums of learning as possible. Use your screen time wisely and watch videos available on the internet on different topics of physics or sci-fi movies and shows. They would definitely help you understand and relate to laws and concepts of Physics. You can also listen to podcasts or panel discussions given by experts in the field of Physics. Visual and audio aids really help in retaining the information and also make learning fun.</span></span></span><br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><strong>Ask questions</strong></span></span><br />
	<span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"">Be inquisitive and ask questions if you have the smallest of the doubt in your mind regarding any concept in Physics. These doubts if not clarified can be a big distraction and would hinder your leaning in the short as well as the long run. Asking the questions at the right time is equally important to build your knowledge. Asking questions keeps you engaged in the subject. Research shows that answers received to your own questions are more likely to be remembered by you.</span></span></span><br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><strong>Discuss with your peers</strong></span></span><br />
	<span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"">Discussing what you have studied in class with your peers is a great way to gauge your understanding of the subject as well as revising it. You can also get your questions clarified while discussing with your peers if you don&rsquo;t get a chance to do so in class. On the other hand, helping out your peers with a topic he/she has not understood well will also help you get a deeper understanding of the subject.</span></span></span><br />

If you belong in the latter, this can definitely be a problem, considering the fact that most science subjects like chemistry require extra dedication.<br />
<br />
More often than not, students can&rsquo;t just settle on the aid the teacher can provide. Without additional assistance, it wouldn&rsquo;t be farfetched to say that it can be impossible to improve your grades. And if you&rsquo;re already struggling, you probably couldn&rsquo;t agree more. This is why you have to be willing to look at all the tools at your disposal nowadays, hence, this multi-pronged approach. We hope that this will allow you to lock on to what you should be focusing on more.<br />
<br />
<u><strong>Ways to Boost Your Chemistry Grades</strong></u><br />
<br />
A multi-pronged approach is very effective because it lets you gain fall-backs and other additional options to greatly improve your grades. It lets you take better control of your studies, in short, without having to rely on your teacher alone. Almost all major science subjects undoubtedly require nothing less. Of course, that is not to say that we will not be sharing tips to help you hone your study habits better.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif""><span style=""color:null""><strong>1. Be More Proactive in Pinpointing the Flaws in Your Study Habits</strong><br />
<br />
If you are getting less-than-desirable grades, it goes without saying that you need to start paying attention to your study habits. Regardless of whether you like chemistry or not, it is no excuse for you to be half-hearted when it comes to studying it. This only readily translates to poor school performance. Reflect on these questions to know what the flaws are so you&rsquo;ll know what to improve on:</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif""><span style=""color:null"">- How dedicated are you in improving your chemistry grades?<br />
- Are you taking the time to do a quick review of the assigned materials before going to your classes?<br />
- Are you listening to the teacher every lesson and taking down notes of all important topics? Do you re-read them after class?<br />
- Do you ask her questions about the topics you are finding hard to grasp?<br />
- Are you using the latest periodic table of elements?<br />
- Do you use flashcards to help you memorize symbols and formulas?<br />
- Do you take the time to solve problems in a step-by-step manner?<br />
- Do you ask for <a href=""https://thesisgeek.com/coursework-help.php"" target=""_blank"">coursework help</a> if you are experiencing great difficulties in writing it?</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif""><span style=""color:null"">Having solid, positive answers to these questions will affirm just how effective your current study habits are. Otherwise, you should pinpoint the areas you&rsquo;re weak at or are aware that you are doing falling short on then proceed to proactively address them. Even if the questions asked won&rsquo;t be exactly similar, you will, at least, gain an inkling of how exam questions are asked and answered.<br />
<br />
<strong>2. Gain Access to Past Exams and Practice on Them</strong><br />
<br />
If you have no problem grasping the main concepts and formulas, but still have trouble with exam questions (which is a fairly common occurrence), then make the effort to acquire past exam papers, use them as a reference, and practice on the questions asked there.<br />
<br />
It is not uncommon for lab questions to require a more detailed explanation, for instance, of why a certain element behaves in a specific way or has unique characteristics that affect their reaction to various stimuli. Knowing how you should answer.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Also, since these questions also demonstrate or reveal the answer in detail, they also serve as a great way for you to grasp practically any topic. Many students can attest to how effective this is in boosting grades directly.<br />
<br />
<strong>3. Join a Chemistry Study Group</strong><br />
<br />
Study groups abound for practically every major science subject so it won&rsquo;t be a surprise if there is one in your school as well. Participating in a well-organized study group that is dedicated to helping every member succeed is very invaluable for any student, to say the least. After all, it is a concentrated effort by a group, and as far as any endeavour is concerned, this always leads to favourable results.<br />
<br />
Of course, that is assuming the group is that dedicated. If not, then you should really make the effort to make it as such. Encourage everyone to share their notes, what they&rsquo;re struggling with, explain concepts clearly and more in-depth, and schedule times to study before an exam. As long as you can impart discipline in your group, you&rsquo;ll be reaping the fruits in no time.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif""><span style=""color:null""><strong>4. There are Great Chemistry Apps Out There, Use Them</strong><br />
<br />
Technology should never be exempt from the equation if you are trying to improve your grades. WIth apps dedicated to learning chemistry, you can do just that and discover more insights into how you can enhance your study habits better.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Those that stand out manage to give you the full arsenal, so to speak. From tutorials and flashcards to unique quizzes you can do for self-assessments. A couple also serves as a comprehensive collection of tools that you will find to be indispensable before long. For example, wouldn&rsquo;t it great to have a dictionary of chemical symbols on hand that will provide you with the definitions of each one in seconds? How about topping it off with a molecular mass calculator that you can use anytime? Wouldn&rsquo;t it be fascinating to have an interactive view of each element at an atomic level?<br />

In a world poised to enjoy the fruits of the technologies mentioned above, there will never be a shortage for luminous minds with ideas that will unlock the true capabilities of those technologies.&nbsp;</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"">The depth and personalisation that characterises international baccalaureate education only makes it a fitting subfield education in which these seeds should be sown. IB education has the inherent intent of shaping the individual as a whole, and many can attest to its inimitable benefits. The level of education the student receives is unmatched; although the challenges are obviously just as lofty. But, in the end, as many can attest, they are all worth it.&nbsp;</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"">In Singapore, plenty of international schools that are undeniably innovation-oriented are <a href=""https://www.nexus.edu.sg/"">Nexus international school</a> and <a href=""https://www.gwa.edu.sg/"">GEMS World Academy.</a> Both are recognised as truly world-class international schools that exemplify what IB education is all about. This could not be more apparent in the unique ways that these educational institutions are educating their students.&nbsp;</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"">What&rsquo;s certain is that technology is almost always at the forefront of their teaching process, which also has a tendency to be holistic in nature; holistic in such a way that the education of the student continues well beyond the classroom through myriad co-curricular activities that are not only engaging but fosters creativity, too.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><img alt="""" src=""https://tutorcity.sg/admin_tutor/attachments/uploads/educational_tech.jpg"" style=""height:598px; width:900px"" /></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><strong><span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"">2. Schools are now more open to using learning management tools to aid and enhance their teaching.</span></span></strong><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"">These tools, after all, have been proven to help ensure the student&rsquo;s educational progress. In IB programmes, students normally have what is called an IB learner profile, which in essence serves as a looking-glass through which they and their teachers can immediately view their progress not only in academics but in other &ldquo;<a href=""https://www.ibo.org/benefits/learner-profile/"">human capacities and responsibilities</a>&rdquo; as well.&nbsp;</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"">These, besides multilingualism, serve as the core tenets of IB education. In short, these management tools benefit IB education on a fundamental level, which is virtually what every educational innovation should aim for. Not only do they save the teacher plenty of time but they also actively enhance both teaching and learning in any kind of IB school.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"">How do they manage to achieve this? Well, most are designed with modern pedagogy in mind. They, more or less, tackle the issues that limit and make IB education more difficult for all involved (namely the administrators, teachers, students, and parents). This could not be more apparent in the basic features of LMS designed for IB education specifically:</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"">- Most are able to serve as platforms through which smooth and ready communication can be achieved between everyone. This is unsurprising as plenty of IB-based learning management systems are centred around improving communication and collaboration.</span></span><br />
<span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"">-&nbsp;Conducting student assessments, tracking attendance, and any other school activity, co-curricular or otherwise, are made possible and easy.</span></span><br />
<span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"">-&nbsp;Any kind of IB report needed to be made can be generated based on the data available in the LMS.&nbsp;</span></span><br />
<span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"">-Curriculums, facilitating documents, and even lessons can be stored in the LMS and shared in the classroom or the entire school community in no time.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><strong>3. International schools in Singapore are now starting to rely a lot on online and digital resources to improve the student&rsquo;s overall learning experience.</strong></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><a href=""https://www.nexus.edu.sg/"">Nexus international school</a> is an Apple Distinguished School, an accolade given only to schools that welcome innovation. They are known for using a unique teaching model called Substitution, Augmentation, Modification, and Redefinition (SAMR). It allows learners to research topics with remarkable speeds and makes online collaboration always possible.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"">The school is also open to using apps that use augmented reality in various classes to really heighten the immersion of the students. These apps, in turn, also make group discussions interactive and fun. The same openness to technology is apparent in GEMS World Academy, as is evident in the <a href=""https://www.ischooladvisor.com/view/gems-world-academy-singapore"">testimonials of its students</a> and the plethora of novel, tech-centric workshops it is actively hosting and conducting.&nbsp;</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><strong>4. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are beginning to change the landscape, too</strong>.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"">What had been deemed as science fiction in the past is now a bonafide reality in plenty of classrooms thanks to the advent of AI and machine learning. While these two technologies are arguably more impactful on education as a whole, their effects on IB education could not be denied.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"">Even as we write this, AI systems are now being used in IB classrooms to assess the activities and performances of individual students. This, in turn, allows them to dispense highly personalised feedback that is only crucial to ensuring the development of the learner as a whole. As said above, this is the ultimate goal of most IB education, and it is apparent that AI is the key to not only make it a possibility but a certainty.&nbsp;</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"">Although it is relatively still in its infancy stages and is utilized in a fairly limited number of educational institutions, the fact that AI-driven educational solutions will become readily available in the future is already a good sign that it is paving the way towards the continuous improvement of IB education and education in general.&nbsp;</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"">Machine learning, on the other hand, has proven to be very effective when applied as a way to enhance memorisation and other processes involved in studying. Interactive textbooks powered by this technology only boost these advantages further for they are comparatively more engaging for most students.</span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><strong><span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"">Conclusion</span></span></strong><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"">There is only route IB education is headed thanks to these innovations, and it&rsquo;s not bound to change any time soon. This will only be good for the regular IB student, first, because it equips him with necessary future-oriented knowledge and makes him adaptable to innovations, ultimately making him more open-minded. This fulfills, without a doubt, plenty of the main tenets of international baccalaureate education.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"">Furthermore, as technologies like AI and software like learning management tools continue to evolve and be subsequently applied to IB settings, it will only have a direct effect on the quality of education that he will be receiving in IB schools that implement them. How so? These technologies analyse the performance of the student in a highly personalised and in-depth manner, boost collaboration between teachers and students, and make references and learning resources always within arm&rsquo;s reach.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"">This is why it&rsquo;s safe to say that it&rsquo;s solely a question of when these technologies will begin to permeate IB education completely. Their advantages are just too good - too revolutionary - to miss out on.</span></span><br />

Talking about biology, it has a lot of concepts that can confuse students.<br />
<br />
Besides the various biology terms and their spellings, a student also have to remember how certain biological processes are occurring and what changes take place in each step. Focusing on being prepared and understanding the principles of biology is the key to doing well in the course. Even if you don&#39;t plan to pursue a career in biology, if you learn it methodically it proves out to be an easy subject. </span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">Benefits of hiring <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/biology-tuition""><strong>private biology tutors</strong></a>:</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">Hiring a private home tutor is a common thing as it positively impacts your learning. If you are feeling the struggle to attain good marks in biology, then you should definitely look for a biology home tuition. Benefits of hiring private biology tutors are manifold:</span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">Every student is unique and has different learning needs, and a private tutor will be able to give personalized guidance and this is a huge advantage. Private tutors provide one-on-one engagement, so students are able to focus better and are taught in a way that specifically meets their own unique needs.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">This is a particularly convenient option for students since one can do it from the comfort of their homes, thus reducing lots of undue travelling time on their part.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">A home tutor not only encourages students to do their homework and assist with exam preparation, but also is helpful to students lacking in concentration or ones who get easily distracted while doing homework. </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">Solving the biology sample papers on a weekly basis is crucial for getting the best results since it helps getting a clear idea about the question pattern along with time management, and private tutors provide the necessary assistance.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">Having a private tutor can help your child have goals, objectives and dreams. </span></span></span></li>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">Here are few ways you can apply to your studies to ace your biology classes and score big in it:</span></span></span></p>

<span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">Biology is a complex subject, so it&#39;s important to pay close attention to biology lectures. You need to be diligent about taking notes on important topics, especially important biology concepts. This will enable you to solidify the material in your mind. Notes are a must when you want to ace an exam. Keep your notes in order and in one place, or it will be hard for you to prepare for your test.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><strong><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">Importance Of Diagram</span></strong><br />
<span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">Diagrams play an important role to understand the concept of it. Check the diagrams associated with certain concepts and study them since studying with the help of diagrams makes it easier to retain the concept on your mind than reading about that structure. Analyze the flowcharts as well since an effective flowchart takes a complex process and simplifies it giving you a clear picture how a particular biological process works and helps you recall how each step happens. </span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><strong><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">Check Previous Year Question Papers</span></strong><br />
<span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">Practicing old papers, or the exam questions listed at the end of each chapter will give you a clear idea regarding the pattern of the paper. Practicing past exam questions will help you evaluate your preparation. </span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Tahoma,sans-serif""><strong><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif"">Wash your hands frequently.</span></strong><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif""> This tip is given on almost every medical website for protecting yourself from almost every virus out there. It is one of the most important tasks we can complete in preventing the spread of illness. Be sure to properly wash your hands any time you visit the restroom, touch surfaces that could harbor viruses or bacteria, handle food, or share supplies with a student. Washing hands upon entering the building, tutoring space, or classroom.</span></span></span><br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Tahoma,sans-serif""><strong><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif"">Know the signs<sup>2</sup>.</span></strong><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif""> Have a stuffy nose? Is this the novel coronavirus or just a cold? Symptoms generally begin with dry cough and fever. <a href=""#_ftn3"" name=""_ftnref3"" title=""""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif"">[3]</span></a> These are not the only symptoms, but if you have a fever, you should stay home. Many students and school employees have been placed on a leave of absence or quarantine order in order to heal or isolate themselves after possible infection. If you suspect you or someone else has symptoms, avoid contact, and wear protective clothing until you may isolate yourself from further potential infection. One tip from <u><a href=""https://www.straitstimes.com/""><em>The Straits Times</em></a></u> suggests that you keep a 1 metre distance. However, as tutors, this is sometimes not possible. Be vigilant. If you see symptoms and do not feel comfortable continuing, let your student know. Offer to reschedule or hold a remote session online or via phone.</span></span></span><br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Tahoma,sans-serif""><strong><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif"">Monitor your symptoms and health. </span></strong><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif"">If you are not feeling well, use a mask, gloves, or other protective clothing. You may also choose to end a session or reschedule. If your agency allows, you may set online or phone sessions if you or your student is not feeling well.</span></span></span><br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Tahoma,sans-serif""><strong><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif"">Monitor student behavior.</span></strong><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif""> If your student is not feeling well, feel free to assert your needs. Simply being in the same room won&rsquo;t necessarily spread the virus, but if you get the virus in your mouth or eyes, you can spread the virus. If you fear the student is contagious, or he or she doesn&rsquo;t appear well enough to continue, follow your agency&rsquo;s protocol for cancelling or rescheduling the session.</span></span></span><br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Tahoma,sans-serif""><strong><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif"">Clean your environment.<sup>2</sup> </span></strong><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif"">Wipe tables with disinfecting wipes before and after each session. Use computer friendly wipes and cleaners to clean surfaces. Keep surfaces clean and free of debris. While the virus must enter the nose, eyes, or mouth, touching the virus can help it to transfer. Cleaning these surfaces will keep the virus at a minimum. </span></span></span></li>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Tahoma,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif"">Remember, you are the first line of defense in keeping yourself healthy.

It is one of the official languages here but people here have incorporated some Chinese and Malay words to make the language their own which is popularly known as Singlish. Also, today&rsquo;s generation is widely exposed to the slangs being used all across the world thanks to the internet and social media.<br />
<br />
Using these slangs becomes a necessity to look cool in front of friends and eventually, it becomes a part of their day to day conversation. While sending text messages as well there are a lot of shortcuts used to spell a word like for &lsquo;you&rsquo; only &lsquo;u&rsquo; is used. Using Singlish, slangs as well as incorrect spellings become a habit and easily integrate in the way we communicate in English. So when it comes to school or university exams we use the same version of English that we use on a day to day basis which results in our grades dropping. Not only in school, but we also need to master the English language to communicate well with the world outside Singapore.</span></span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""color:#16a085""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><strong><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif"">Why is it important to master English?</span></strong></span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""color:null""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif"">English is a Global language. It is also the business language in a large number of countries as well as the language of education. To make yourself ready for the future and create many opportunities in the global market you need to ace the language so that you understand others as well as make sure you are heard. Be it any field science, computers, aviation, tourism or government jobs all require you to be proficient in English. It&#39;s best to focus and master the language while you are in school as research shows that learning a language in your early years can help you master it faster as well as you already have all the learning aids available with you while in school. &nbsp;</span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif"">As English is the language of education, in case you want to go overseas for higher education it is a must to have a good command over the English language. This will not only help you do better at your studies but also help you settle in faster in the new country. Every country has a local lingo with different words having different means in each region. It&rsquo;s always better to use standard English to avoid confusion or disrespecting anyone.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif"">On the lighter side, mastering English would also give you access to a vast wealth of entertainment as most of the popular movies, TV shows, songs and books are in English. This would also help you understand different cultures better. Also, as half the content available on the internet is in English you would be able to access these pages of information easily. Sometimes a lot of key information is lost in translation so why rely on Google translation or subtitles anymore. </span></span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""color:#16a085""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><strong><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif"">Why engaging an English tuition teacher a necessity?</span></strong></span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""color:null""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif"">Even though English is the sole medium of teaching in Singapore, a lot of students are struggling to get good grades in English. Both the students and parents don&rsquo;t give it too much importance assuming it is an easy subject. In reality, English is a very peculiar language with a lot of grammatical rules and also hundreds of exceptions to those rules. One needs to practice to get a good command over the language. It&#39;s equally important to get the right guidance for English as well like we get for other subjects like mathematics and science.<br />
<br />
Here are some of the reasons why you should engage a good English tutor</span></span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif""><span style=""color:null"">English is also all about practice. An </span><a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/english-tuition"" target=""_blank""><span style=""color:null"">English tutor</span></a><span style=""color:null""> would help you practice what you have learned in school. A good tutor would also help you learn the general rules of the language to enhance your overall communication skills. To get a good command over the language one needs to practice speaking, reading, and writing which a tutor will make sure you do.</span></span></span></span><br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><span style=""color:null""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif"">To excel in other subjects as well one needs to have a good understanding of English. If you are unable to comprehend you won&rsquo;t be able to do well in any of the other subjects be it mathematics, science or geography.</span></span></span></span><br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><span style=""color:null""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif"">If you have a good command over the English language, you could also participate in extracurricular activities like debates and quizzes. An English tuition teacher&nbsp;can help in this aspect as well as the tutors not only help students prepare for school exams but give them overall coaching of the language. </span></span></span></span></li>

<br />
<span style=""color:null""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif"">We have listed some tried and tested techniques that are sure to help you ace the English language not only in school but also make you future-ready.&nbsp; </span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><strong><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif"">Read books &amp; magazines: </span></strong><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif"">One of the best ways to improve your vocabulary and grammar is to read as many books as possible outside of your course. Magazines are also a great way to improve your comprehension of the language and also keep yourself updated with the current affairs and opinions of different people. </span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><strong><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif"">Play word games: </span></strong><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif"">Playing word games is a fun way to learn new words and spellings. It could be both board games or on the internet or mobile. There are a plethora of games available these days in the market or on App stores that can help improve your English speaking, spelling, writing, comprehension, and grammar skills.</span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><strong><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif"">Think in English: </span></strong><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif"">Thinking in English will help you in your sentence formation and minimize grammatical errors. If you think in your native language and just translate it while speaking you are bound to make mistakes. If you adopt this practice you are sure to become fluent in English as you learn to think and speak at the same speed. </span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><strong><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif"">Improve your speaking skills: </span></strong><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif"">Make sure you speak in English more often with your peers, friends, and family. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to make mistakes rather focus on correcting your mistakes.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif"">Being in Singapore which is vastly an English speaking country, we take English for granted and don&rsquo;t make any extra efforts to master it as we are raised speaking the language. We don&rsquo;t realize how important it is to improve our English language skills and avoid using the colloquial version of it. But it&rsquo;s never too late; do follow our simple techniques to ace this wonderful language. </span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif"">Getting help from experts is also a very good way to get a command over the language. They would give you individual attention, focus on your weaker areas at your pace and time. We have a team of experienced English tutors&nbsp;for primary school, secondary school, junior college for both local and international board and even for business level.

Chinese is not the easiest language to learn because of reasons, such as</span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">Chinese isn&#39;t a phonetic language meaning it doesn&#39;t use an alphabet, it&#39;s a pictorial language.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">Chinese tones are hard. One needs to listen first to comprehend the tone and adding tone to every word spoken can be a difficult process for non-native speakers. </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">A lot of memorization goes into learning the language. You need to memorize four different things for each word. </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">Though lack of grammar can make it easy to get started, but hard to get good, particularly in spoken conversations where characters aren&#39;t there to simplify things. </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">Last, but not the least there are many dialects of the Chinese language family, such as Shanghainese and Ningbonese that still might be difficult to comprehend. </span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">There are various misconceptions about learning the language to the extent that some claim that it is rather challenging, but how is that so? Research has found a list of the most common reasons to throw light on this subject, which are as follows:</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><strong><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">Lack of proper facilities</span></strong><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">It is a real challenge if you do not have the right people to teach and guide you. Proper tools in place can enhance the learning.</span></span></span></p>

<br />
<span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">Japanese and Koreans will find it easier to grasp the language due to the similarities in comparison to Europeans, Americans and the English (who will have a hard time) since the phonics, syllabication, grammar completely varies. </span></span></span></p>

Moreover, the language is key to career opportunities in China.</span></span></span></p>

<br />
<span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">In the face of China&#39;s emerging presence on the global scale, fluency in Chinese might add to your resume and expand your career prospects. Attending Mandarin lessons alone might not get you a job in the first place, but they can give you an edge over your competitors. More and more companies are looking to lock down employees who are proficient in multiple languages, enabling them to expand and go international. </span></span></span></p>

<br />
<span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">Researchers found that learning a new language like Chinese is similar to that of a brain exercise that strengthens your brain&rsquo;s natural ability to focus, which enables your mind to be stronger and much more creative. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"">In February 2020, there have been more than 90 confirmed cases of Covid-19 that originated in China and has infected more than 80,000 people there so far. A common practice by Singaporean parents is engaging a private tuition teacher to come to their home for tutoring services.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"">These tutors teach a wide variety of subjects and are willing to travel to the students&rsquo; home for convenience purposes. However, with the rise in the number of COVID-19 cases in Singapore, there is a heightened fear of transmission of the virus as private tutors travel from one student&rsquo;s home to another. Many students are turning to alternative ways of assistance with their assignments or homework.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><strong><u>Online Tuition &ndash; video conferencing gains traction in Singapore</u></strong></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"">The increased popularity of online lessons has increased dramatically which coincides with the outbreak of the virus. Having lessons over the internet is the ideal choice for concerned parents and students because this avoids face to face interaction and there is no spread of droplets, which is the main form of transmission of the virus. <a href=""https://mypaperwriter.com/college-paper-help.htm"" target=""_blank"">College paper help</a> is also available through online platforms, providing students with additional resources to complete their assignments and improve their knowledge on various subjects.<br />
<br />
The most remarkable advantage of video conferencing systems is that it is an excellent tool for teaching students, especially the students from different backgrounds. For tutors, you can communicate with your classroom through the help of conferencing. In real time communication the students can ask the question by themselves, or they can ask questions that are related to the subject which you are teaching. Hence it becomes a great help for the students. You can also choose a small screen with two cameras, where you can position a projection screen and one camera at each side. The students can see each other face to face, while other ones can see them with the help of screens.</span></span><br />

<span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"">Ms Denise Koh, a maths teacher who earned a government scholarshop in a top university, is now a fulltime home tutor for more than 12 years. She now has to conduct lessons via Skype on request from her existing students. She said this way helps her to continuously help her students who would otherwise have stop tuition completely.</span></span></span></p>

English is used as the medium of instruction in Singapore&#39;s education system, so students mostly use English instead of Chinese to converse with their friends and teachers. No wonder why so many students in Singapore are weak in the language.<br />
<br />
Chinese language is increasingly essential in today&#39;s context in view of the growing influence of China in the global market. Make yourself a very attractive hire with fluent Chinese speaking skills since employees proficient in the language are more attractive to employers in the job market, and this can of course mean very lucrative wages. </span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">Chinese has developed a misconstrued reputation for difficulty. The truth is learning Mandarin is easier that you think since the language is free from complicated honorific grammar. There are no verbs, no tenses, no plurals, no subject-verb agreement, and no conjugations.<br />
<br />
In fact, Chinese could be regarded as a more logical language because out of over 80,000 Chinese characters, generally only 3,500 are used in conversation. Also, studies have shown Mandarin speakers use both sides of their brains, which will certainly keep brains motoring. </span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">Most parents opt for primary/<strong><a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg"">secondary Chinese tuition</a> </strong>to improve their child&#39;s proficiency in the language. The language is becoming more widespread than ever before and outstanding Chinese speaking skills can open more opportunities for people in the world.<br />
<br />
Additionally, high exam scores can give your child more benefits when choosing a secondary school and junior college. Last, but not the least having a well-experienced Chinese tutor can form a solid foundation for your child. He/she can reignite your child&#39;s interest in the language, making learning the language a joy rather than a mundane task. </span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">Here are some activities you can use to make learning Chinese easier for the kids:</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><strong><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">Provide Them With Chinese Resources</span></strong><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">If you are keen for your child to learn Mandarin in a way that he/she perceives to be a bit easier, get your child some good books on language learning including an English-Chinese dictionary, a Chinese vocabulary book and a Chinese grammar book, etc. An effective way for learning Chinese is to get them learning digitally. Download an app according to your child&#39;s level.<br />
<br />
Apps like DuoLingo is a free and very popular language learning app dominating the market. Give unlimited access to Chinese audiovisual resources such as YouTube channels, Chinese movies with famous actors, etc. Then there are Chinese board games, video games to make learning fun. </span></span></span></p>

<br />
<span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">A good tutor can make a huge difference in the learning process. Extra academic support is sometimes necessary for helping children achieve their best.<br />
<br />
The private tutor will act as a guide and will be able to offer additional insight into the country&#39;s culture rather than simply teaching them in a conventional manner. The biggest advantage with private tutoring is you&#39;re usually the only student and thus get all of the focus.</span></span></span></p>

The citizens do not have freedom of speech, they are forced to wear distinctive clothing, the others, the workers, are allowed to speak freely, however, they must stick to their assigned roles and to an assigned location, where they are supposed to follow the instructions of the authorities. All those who have betrayed the government are executed without trial, the others are sent to a camp.

It is also one of the first stories to use &quot;continuity&quot; (where two or more elements of a story are retained in different versions). Tolkien wrote the tale from beginning to end over a period of two years, which makes the writing style somewhat archaic.&nbsp;J.R.R. Tolkien was one of the greatest authors in English history. His stories are known around the world and are considered classics.&nbsp;</p>

<p>9.&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/1781396833?tag=s7621-20"">The Great Gatsby</a><br />

<p>13.&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/1853260207?tag=s7621-20"">Animal Farm: A Fairy Story</a></p>

<p>What makes Animal Farm: A Fairy Story a good book? Well, in the first place, the &quot;serious&quot; novel that it is not just funny in form but also in point of view. George Orwell&#39;s story, in all probability, came with an agenda: to expose Soviet propaganda by making people think about what they really are. And who can argue with this fact? The book revolves around a group of farm animals who rebels against their farmer, hoping to establish a society where they can be free and happy. But the rebellion is betrayed and the farm ends up under a dictatorship instead.</p>

<p>In Gone with the Wind, Scarlett O&#39;Hara has her journey of a lifetime, as she meets several interesting people and ends up marrying Henry Hudson. However, the romance of this novel takes a turn when Scarlett&#39;s love life begins to develop.&nbsp;Margaret Mitchell was one of the greatest writers of the 20th century. She became famous during World War II, writing a series of novels centered on the exploits of Scarlett O&#39;Hara. After the war, she wrote a number of popular novels about two warring families in the South. The novels include The Help, Gone with the Wind, The House of Mirth, and to name a few.&nbsp;With its portrayal of the strength and survival of a person&#39;s soul after death, Margaret Mitchell&#39;s <em>Gone with the Wind</em> remains a classic book.&nbsp;The result is a tale of the beauty of family and the peace of heart, especially in the face of the challenges of the Civil War. It is a tale of strength and determination.</p>

<p>15.&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/159463193X?tag=s7621-20"">The Kite Runner</a></p>

<p>&quot;The Kite Runner&quot; is a&nbsp;great book about love and friendship and it will be one of the best novels you will&nbsp;ever read. The story is truly inspiring and teaches us about all kinds of love, especially inspiring about love in the face of adversity. A heartbreaking story about a wealthy boy and the son of his father&#39;s servent, set against the backdrop of a country in the process of being destroyed.</p>

<strong>3 reasons why you should start reading a book (if you haven&#39;t already!)</strong><br />
<br />
The reasons to read a book are manifold.&nbsp;However, for some reason, there is a lot of miscommunication regarding these reasons to read a book. One common notion that bothers me is that it is necessary to read a book just to improve your English. Some even argue that if you do not read, you will never improve.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are 3 main reasons to learn English. These reasons are: <span style=""color:#8e44ad""><em>A great communication with your foreign partners, overcoming illiteracy and to enjoy life</em></span>.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is one of the reasons to read a book because it helps you learn the English language and improve your essay writing skills. If you need help, you can approach <a href=""https://studycrumb.com/"" target=""_blank"">studycrumb</a> for assistance with writing good essays.&nbsp;When you read it, you are more able to read texts in other languages. And with this skill, you will have an advantage in your career.</p>

<p>We always hear about learning English but sometimes we just forget to look for ways to learn. Therefore, it makes sense to read a book and improve your language skills. It is true that there are online courses but at the end of the day, it is not practical to study online.</p>

<p><span style=""color:#8e44ad"">1. Learn English from books. In order to learn English, you must read a book so that you can increase your vocabulary. This will allow you to understand how the English language works.</span></p>

<p><span style=""color:#8e44ad"">2. You can also learn by watching television or reading. This will help you improve the things you learned from the book. Of course, it will not replace the book.</span></p>

<p><span style=""color:#8e44ad"">3. You can also learn by doing the exercises or the drills that the book provides. This is a good way to improve your vocabulary. It also gives you a sense of achievement because you already mastered the things.</span></p>

<p>Reading&nbsp;is a good way to learn a new language and will give you many benefits in your overall quest for knowledge.<br />

Exams are just around the corner and you must have started preparing, but there are several other factors that you are worried about, like having trouble recalling what you studied, not being able to make time for revision, so on and so forth. </span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">There are proven ways to enhance your memory and reduce stress before an exam. There are a few study hacks, practicing which can help improve your memory and ultimately help you do better in your exams:</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><strong><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">Walk- </span></strong><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">There are proven benefits of walking in boosting your memory and brain power. Taking a walk 20 minutes before the exam can enhance brain functioning and greatly improve performance.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><strong><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">Teach What You&rsquo;ve Learned</span></strong><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">- The best way to learn is to teach someone. In your school, volunteer to help students understand the things that you need to know. If you find yourself struggling, it means you don&rsquo;t know it well enough and have to study more yourself.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><strong><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">Write It Down</span></strong><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">- The best way to internalize large amounts of information is by writing the information down, which will help your brain remember the concepts, which could be in terms of simple text, charts, pictures and diagrams. </span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><strong><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">Create An Acronym</span></strong><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">- Developing acronyms is a useful tactic for remembering information in a certain order. Another useful tactic is to draw diagrams which will help you to visualize information which otherwise would be hard to describe. During your exam, you&rsquo;d be able to easily recall the visual memory in your mind. The same holds true for acronyms that help to make complicated notions easier for our brain to remember.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><strong><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">Break Huge Information Into Small Segments</span></strong><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">- The best way to take information into your brain is by taking in information in small doses instead of intaking various information at once. It can cause stress. As per studies, the brain works best when you take in no more than four pieces of information at a time. This way, you are more likely to internalize the information.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><strong><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">Group Study</span></strong><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">- It&rsquo;s always helpful to conduct study groups that can help students learn course material in a deeper, more concrete way. In study groups, students can help one another internalize concepts that some are finding trouble learning since it&rsquo;s likely that someone in your class is an expert at a particular topic that you or any of your peers might be struggling with. </span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><strong><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">Get Adequate Rest</span></strong><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">- Countless hours you spend studying will be pointless without adequate sleep, make sure to get adequate rest the nights leading up to your exams. It is crucial to get a good night&rsquo;s sleep to remember those answers and formulas you need for your exam. </span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><strong><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">Read Out Loud</span></strong><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">- Instead of simply reading in your mind, read out aloud since you are more likely to remember something when you say it loudly. Read your study material out loud, and you&rsquo;d be surprised at how much more likely you are to remember the concept come exam time. </span></span></span></p>

Parents every so often face the catch-22 situation of whether they should hire a tutor for their child, if the tuition would be worth the time and money.<br />
<br />
Remember that individual teaching can be a tremendously productive addition to a child&rsquo;s studies. Private tutors help by making it easier for your children to unlock their potential.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">If your child shows any of these signs, it is time to seek the help of a qualified <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/maths-tuition"">Maths tutor</a> in order to take your child&rsquo;s academic achievement to the next level:</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><strong><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">Grades Are Dropping</span></strong><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">Some parents don&rsquo;t take action the first time their child&rsquo;s grade decline. They wait for more evidence, say examination results, of declining grades, which is unhealthy for your child. Poor exams or tests results are the best indicators that your child needs a tutor&rsquo;s assistance.<br />
<br />
Don&rsquo;t wait for the outcome of examinations, you should find a temporary remedy to reverse the grade drop. The teacher can point out concepts your child is struggling with. He or she will identify a child&rsquo;s weaknesses and take proactive steps to strengthen them. Delay in making an informed decision might result in a decline in performance of your child in the next exam.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><strong><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">Diminished Self-Esteem</span></strong><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">Some children are slow learners, and they only need more time or a different approach to grasp the lessons. Your child may fall behind others since a regular classroom set-up doesn&rsquo;t leave room for a custom learning method. Your child may start to feel conscious about his inability to get good grades in maths due to diminished self-esteem, which can put your child in an emotionally bad place.<br />
<br />
A tutor can help to bolster their self-belief by improving his/her ability to grasp the subject. As parents, encourage your child to face their fears instead of running away.<br />
<br />
Successful tutoring will help your child gain newfound confidence, which will lead to active participation in the classroom.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><strong><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">Lack Of Enthusiasm In Learning</span></strong><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">An early sign that you should consider getting a tutor is when your child gets distracted from doing their homework. It&rsquo;s possible they&rsquo;re getting bored or lacks focus (maths lessons might not be challenging enough), that&rsquo;s where a tutor can come in.<br />
<br />
Also, children start avoiding subjects</span> <span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">when they find them difficult to follow especially mathematics. A maths tutor will make the studies simple to follow with equation, explanations and shortcuts, thus reigniting your child&rsquo;s interest in maths. </span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><strong><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">Decreased Parental Guidance</span></strong><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">When parents take on additional commitments outside of the family, it may become difficult to maintain the same level of homework help they had been offering their child.<br />
<br />
It&rsquo;s also possible that parents may no longer fully understand the lessons their children are taking since it&rsquo;s been long that they&rsquo;ve been out of school. In the face of evolved teaching methods and changed curriculums, you may find it difficult to help your children solve their academic problems, even if you are an adept at Maths. A tutor can step in to help.</span></span></span></p>

Physics can be a fun subject as it is such a wide field involving the study of motion, gravity, energy, fluids, and areas like thermodynamics and quantum physics. The fear of Physics among students can be attributed to the number of mathematical problems the subject has, and requires critical thinking to link concepts into a unified vision. </span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">It is in the Secondary, Junior College or IB levels that Physics is introduced, either as pure Physics or combined Physics-Chemistry, and students are taught from the very basic and general form and its progress, as the difficulty rises with introduction of specializations. Private <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/physics-tuition""><strong>physics tuition</strong></a> in Singapore can help your child ace the exam.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">Let&rsquo;s glance through a few tips below to help you gain an understanding of Physics and score well in the exam:</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><strong><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">Master the fundamental Concepts</span></strong><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">- Avoid memorizing problems, better you understand the basic concepts and theories along with their principles, and work out problems. It&rsquo;s of no use memorizing complex problems since it is very likely that the problems you&rsquo;ll have to solve in the exam will be based on core concepts (central theories) or with a slight variation of these. </span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">When you sign up for Physics tuition in Singapore, you&rsquo;ll get to learn many topics, such as mechanics, radioactivity, electricity, x-rays, universe, properties of matter, light, etc. </span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><strong><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">Catch Up On Math</span></strong><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">- Good math skills are a prerequisite for success in Physics since there are a number of mathematical parameters that are utilized in physics. If you have the capability to handle and solve many problems and formulas, then mastering Physics will be a cakewalk for you. You should at least have a good grasp of algebra, trigonometry and calculus.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><strong><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">Analyze Problems</span></strong><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">- Try to simplify the problem as much as possible. Solving problems in physics might seem tough on the surface, but begin to analyze it and in no time will you realize it to be easier than you thought. </span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><strong><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">Utilize Drawings</span></strong><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">- Drawings can play a big role in understanding the concepts and detailed parts of physics. It is advisable to always present any concept with a help of drawing, so whenever possible, perform a drawing to illustrate a concept as it would help you score more and understand better.</span></span></span></p>

Let&#039;s see how you can start too!","social media marketing,social media career,marketing job","social_media_career.jpg","<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><em>Do you want to know how to kickstart your social media marketing career?<br />
<br />
How can you use social media marketing as a stepping stone for the launch of your new career?<br />
<br />
Does it really matter how to start your own business or not?</em></p>

<p>The answer is YES, it does matter how to kickstart your social media marketing career. The trick is to go about it in the right way.</p>

<p>You can kickstart your social media career by using one of the thousands of free online resources available on the internet. There are many such free online resources available on the internet today - but the one most people use is <a href=""https://blogger.com"">blogger.com</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Start off with blogging</strong></p>

<p>Blogging is an amazing tool to use, especially if you want to build your reputation. However, here&#39;s the catch.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re new to blogging, your <a href=""https://zyro.com/blog/personal-website-examples/"" target=""_blank"">personal website</a> can be a terrific way to start your online marketing career. There are several reasons for this.</p>

<p>First, with a personal website, you can find your niche. And once you&#39;ve found your niche, you can use it to promote your business. Also, once you&#39;ve built up your personal website, you can start a Blogger account.</p>

<p>Next, once you&#39;ve done that, using your social media marketing skills to get traffic to your new website can be a great way to launch your social media marketing career. And your social media marketing skills should improve when you start blogging and getting traffic to your blog. It&#39;s like a cycle - blogs help you get traffic to your website, which can drive more traffic to your social media pages.</p>

<p>Now, even if you&#39;re already on a social media platform, and you don&#39;t have a personal website, blogging is a great way to get traffic and build up your reputation. You can also use a blog to leverage your other marketing efforts. You can optimize your articles, create some social media content, and turn those articles into a link on your personal website.<br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""background-color:white""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif""><span style=""font-size:10.5pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;""><span style=""color:#222222""><img alt="""" src=""https://tutorcity.sg/admin_tutor/attachments/uploads/socialmedia.jpg"" style=""height:332px; width:500px"" /></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><br />
<strong>Once you&#39;re ready to launch your blog, there are three things you can do.</strong></p>

<p>The first is to join Google&#39;s Blogger program.</p>

<p>The second is to create a free website.</p>

<p>The third is to find some social media platforms that help you get traffic to your blog and start building up your reputation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Your reputation is important to your business success. It will allow you to build trust with your customers. Using your social media marketing skills to build up your reputation also helps you to get ranked higher in search engines. Once you start ranked higher in search engines, you&#39;ll find that your customers can trust you, and you&#39;ll start to build trust. Trust, which is critical to any online business.</p>

<p>It&#39;s important that your reputation is built, because you need to build trust with your customers before you can sell them anything. And the best way to build trust is to build a reputation of having good customer service. The best customer service, you build up over time, the more satisfied customers you have, and the more money you&#39;ll make.</p>

<p>In building your <a href=""https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/social-proof-interactive-content/"" target=""_blank"">social media marketing strategy</a>, you need to think about the three keys for success. These three keys are easy to remember but are actually not easy to apply in reality.</p>

<p><br />
<strong>Content Creation</strong></p>

<p>The first one is content creation. If you haven&#39;t created some form of content before, now is the time to do so. Content is the lifeblood of your social media marketing strategy.</p>

<p>You have to know your market. It may sound like an obvious statement, but many times it&#39;s not so simple. Market research, and analysis to find out what your customers want and need will go a long way towards making sure that you have a strong content creation strategy. One helpful tip is to use tools such as <a href=""https://www.adobe.com/express/create/post/instagram"" target=""_blank"">Instagram story maker</a> to create engaging content for your readers.&nbsp;You have to be prepared to go the extra mile if your content is anything less than perfect.</p>

<p>Because of the tremendous growth of social media, more businesses are going into this space to try and get ahead of their competition. If you don&#39;t have a strong content strategy in place, then you may be at a disadvantage if you&#39;re trying to compete in this sector.</p>

<p>So that is the first key to your success in building your social media marketing strategy, you need to be able to use content as your primary weapon. This doesn&#39;t mean you have to write the same content over again, but you should create original content on a regular basis. You should of course, start by improving your <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/english-tuition"">essay writing</a> skills.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Competitor Analysis</strong></p>

<p>Next, you should prepare your competitor analysis. This will help you in identifying your market. Your competitor analysis will also help you identify what you should do to stand out and differentiate yourself from your competitors. It will also help you see the opportunities in each market you enter.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t just have a competitor analysis. You have to make that analysis work for you. I have often heard people say that there is no such thing as too much analysis. Well, that&#39;s definitely not true. If you do a poor job with your analysis, it could mean that you have fallen behind your competitors.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Industry Focus</strong></p>

<p>The third key to success in building your social media marketing strategy is to focus on one industry. Many businesses choose to focus on just one particular industry to build their content marketing strategy. However, a better approach is to create a content strategy for an entire industry.</p>

<p>This strategy means that you will produce different content. This makes your content more unique and different. With unique content come brand awareness and credibility.</p>","1","2020-04-03","2022-10-11 10:49:25"

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"">Since we were young kids we have been asked this question over and over again by our family, friends, and teachers &ldquo;What do you want to become when you grow up?&rdquo; For some, the answer was very clear in their minds and remained constant while for others the answer kept changing over the years. But after we finish our N-level or 0-level exams is when we really need to be sure of our career choices and work towards it.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"">Deciding between Junior college (JC) and Polytechnic (Poly) is the first hurdle that we need to cross to achieve our ultimate career goal. But both these options are equally good and have their pros and cons which make it a very difficult decision to make. In this article, we will shed some light on both JC and Polytechnic education in Singapore which would help you make an informed decision while choosing your path.</span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><strong>WHAT IS JC &amp; POLYTECHNIC?</strong></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"">Let&rsquo;s start with the basics and understand both these options in detail. </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><strong>Junior College</strong></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/jc-tuition"">Junior College</a> in Singapore is a 2 years program offered to students after they complete secondary school. Students have a choice between the two streams Science and Arts but are required to take one contrasting subject, for example, a science student would have to select an Arts subject and vice-versa. Apart from these subjects, one mother tongue language is mandatory but if a student has taken the Higher Mother Tongue language paper at the O-level and has obtained a minimum grade of &#39;D7&#39; they are exempted from taking formal MTL lessons and examinations but would still need to attend MTL-related enrichment.<br />
<br />
The subjects are categorized into levels &ndash; Higher 1 (H1), Higher 2 (H2) and Higher 3 (H3) with each of them carry points known as Academic Unit (AU). H1 papers carry one AU, H2 carries 2 AU and H3 carries 1 AU but is offered to students who are academically capable to deal with with this additional subject. H3 subjects are a complimentary subject to the H2 subjects providing more in-depth and advance learning. The advantage of taking an H3 subject is that the students can get an exemption in university for certain modules based on the course and module taken.<br />
<br />
The general subject combination is 3 H2 subjects and 1 H1 subject or 4 H2 subjects along with the 3 mandatory subjects Mother tongue language, Project work, and General paper or Knowledge &amp; Inquiry making it a total of a minimum of 10 AU (3H2+1H1+1MTL+1PW+1GP/KI) and a maximum of 12 AU (4H2+1H3+1MTL+1PW+1GP/KI). The students at the end of the 2 years give the Singapore GCE Cambridge <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/a-level-tuition"">A-Level examinations</a> and based on the scores apply to universities.</span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><strong>Polytechnic</strong></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"">A <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/university-tuition"">polytechnic</a> in Singapore offers students a 3 years program with a variety of courses to choose from. Students can specialize in the field they are interested in and need not study any other subjects. The focus of polytechnics is to provide hands-on and practice-based learning. Internships or work attachments are an integral part of polytechnics ranging from 6 weeks to 6 months or even more for some courses.<br />
<br />
These work attachments give the students a flavor of the industry and provide on-the-job training by industry experts. In polytechnics, more emphasis is given on the application of the knowledge than just the theory hence there a lot of projects for the students to work on.<br />
<br />
This experience also helps them improve their soft skills like communication and presentation skills, creative thinking, problem-solving, collaboration, team-work, and other such life skills. After completing the course, the students are well-trained to join the workforce or sign up for a master&#39;s in the polytechnic itself or the university. </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><strong>HOW TO KNOW YOUR CALLING?</strong></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"">Every individual is different and so are their ways of reaching their goals. When it comes to picking either JC or Poly, remember it is totally your call. You are the best judge as you are the only one who is completely aware of your capabilities. We have listed certain parameters to consider that might help you select your calling.</span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><strong>Duration:</strong> Depending on the time you want to invest in your studies and how eager you are to join the workforce, you can select between JC and Poly. If you want to continue your further studies and go to university, JC will give you a higher chance of getting in. As stats shows, 75% of students are from JC in local universities and only 17% from polytechnics. Polytechnic also gives you an option to join the workforce immediately after you graduate.</span></span><br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><strong>Stress level: </strong>Take into consideration how much stress can you handle.<strong> </strong>In JC the number of subjects to study is more and diverse. One needs to balance their academics as well as CCAs. They follow a packed timetable from Monday to Friday. There could be less time for self-study that could increase the stress levels during exams. Whereas in Polytechnic it&#39;s more relaxed and students get a lot of time to pursue extra-curricular activities.</span></span><br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><strong>Learning Preference: </strong>Do you like being policed or do you prefer studying at your leisure.<strong> </strong>In JC your teachers would keep a close eye on you and your performance and actively keep your parents in the loop. While in Polytechnic students need to take self-initiative and discipline to excel. There won&#39;t be any hand-holding and involves a lot of self-study.</span></span><br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><strong>Career plans: </strong>Choose the right path based on your career plans. If you are still unsure you can opt for JC as it still keeps a lot of avenues open. Polytechnic offers more specialized courses. <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"">Every option has two sides with no wrong or right. Both JC and Polytechnic have their pros and cons and you have to weigh them to judge what suits you the most. The old belief of JC being for the top-performing students and polytechnic is for those who failed to get into JC is now changed.<br />
<br />
Students and parents both are changing their mindset and choosing the option best suited for them. Always think about what you want to do in the future and pick the right option. </span></span></p>

As a parent, you are bound to have your own set of doubts whether this curriculum is going to be the right for your child, and that&rsquo;s completely alright. At the end of the day, your decision will determine your child&rsquo;s future, and one wrong decision could limit his/her options for what and where to study in the coming years.

The only way to stand out in the crowd is by building high credibility and reputation to your tutoring career. Both are important elements of tutoring career. It is only with both of these that your students and their parents will create pleasing nature on you. A huge chunk of tutoring deals with students&rsquo; comfortability. Apart from your knowledge and skills, you must be aware of some tutoring techniques that will not only help you drive more students, but will also help you increase your reputation and gain credibility as an exceptional tutor. It&rsquo;s trust, competence, dynamism and immediacy that is what takes to have teacher credibility. </span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">With hundreds of private tutors competing for tuitions, it&rsquo;s always a good idea to join a Singapore tuition agency to ensure multiple <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/ib-tuition""><strong>IB tuition Singapore</strong></a> assignments, regardless of whether you are doing part-time or full-time teaching as a tutor. </span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">Here&rsquo;s a list of things to avoid when grooming your pupils for success:</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><strong><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">Don&rsquo;t Get Too Personal and Too Physical</span></strong><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">- No matter how old they are or how much you have in common, you are not their buddy, and it&rsquo;s important to draw the line. Develop a rapport with them, but avoid discussing deeply personal topics. Keep your professional relationship just that- <em>professional</em>. No discussion of yours should devolve into friendly banter, as then a student might try to veer off-topic repeatedly. Be careful about not getting caught off-guard by students who are great at striking friendships, but not good at accepting authority. Set boundaries from the first session, and you&rsquo;ll be in a better position to lead the tutoring sessions with ease. Steer clear of developing social media relationship with your pupil since it can also blur the professional lines of your relationship.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">Keep physical interaction between you and your student to a minimum, unless it is relevant to your subject matter. It&rsquo;s important that certain social boundaries be in place. Sit next to your student, your physical interaction should be limited to just high fives and fist bumps.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><strong><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">Make Far-Reaching Promises</span></strong><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">- Every performer knows their capabilities, likewise you should know your boundaries. Don&rsquo;t make far-reaching promises that your tutoring will land them As for the rest of the semester as your students may start expecting the same results in every area/subject. If he or she doesn&rsquo;t succeed, your student could feel like hypothetically cheated. </span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><strong><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">Arrive Underprepared</span></strong><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">- Tutoring is a job that requires preparation, your pupil expects a teacher who has planned the session, not one who&rsquo;s winging it. A tutor who arrives underprepared can create the impression that he or she is unconcerned about the job. Never offer tutoring in a subject you&rsquo;re not comfortable with.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><strong><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">Lose Your Temper</span></strong><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">- While you may feel like hitting your head on wall in exasperation, keep calm and avoid any expressions of anger or frustration. Losing cool isn&rsquo;t conducive to the learning process. </span></span></span></p>

No matter how prepared the student is, anxiety levels are at an all-time high not only for the students but for their parents too during this time. The best way to tackle this hurdle is to remain calm and composed along with giving your 100% to prepare for the exam.<br />
<br />
<a href=""https://www.seab.gov.sg/home/examinations/psle"">Primary school leaving examination (PSLE)</a> is the first national exam children in Singapore take at the end of Primary 6. This is a big exam as bases these score students can enroll in their desired secondary school and select the course of their choice. The students are tested on four subjects - English, Mother Tongue, Mathematics and Science. The raw scores from each of these subjects are converted into T-scores and the sum of these T-score makes the PSLE aggregate score.<br />
<br />
<span style=""color:#e67e22""><u><strong>So what is T-score?</strong></u></span></span></span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">The raw scores are converted to T-scores using s formula to provide the student&rsquo;s relative score as compared to the rest of the students. This means that even if a student has done well in a particular subject and the rest have done exceptionally well, the student&#39;s T-score is likely to come down in that subject. The aggregate T-score will also get affected if a student doesn&rsquo;t perform very well in even one subject. In the PSLE T-score system, every subject is important as well as every point. A student needs to give extra attention to the subject she/he is weak in and can&#39;t just rely on the better subjects to pull up her/his aggregate score.</span></span></span></span><br />

<span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">We believe parents play a vital role in helping their child to do their best, especially in PSLE. Here are some tips that apply to parents whose kids are going to give PSLE this year as well for parents whose kids would be giving the exam in the near future.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:center""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif""><a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/request-tutor"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""Request A Tutor"" src=""https://tutorcity.sg/admin_tutor/attachments/uploads/requestatutor.png"" style=""border-style:solid; border-width:1px; height:263px; width:300px"" /></a></span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif""><span style=""color:#e67e22""><u><strong>6 Tips For Parents</strong></u></span><br />
<br />
<strong>1. Get Involved </strong><br />
As a parent, you should get involved with your child right from the beginning rather than just when the exams are approaching. Understand your child&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses and work with them to chalk out a study plan. Make sure the plans are not too aggressive and rigid but achievable.<br />
<br />
Give your child the flexibility to study at her/his own pace. But monitor their progress regularly and bring them back on track in case there are any major deviations from the learning path. Make sure you as well take out time every day for your child to discuss how their prep is going or to just have a general chat. This time will allow them to raise their concerns, share their worries and also get their questions answered.<br />
<br />
<strong>2. Familiarize yourself with the syllabus </strong><br />
All parents who have studied in Singapore would have given the PSLE. But one needs to remember that things keep changing from time-to-time. There have been multiple changes in PSLE over the years and hence you as parents need to familiarize yourself with the syllabus before helping out your child.<br />
<br />
Also, keep yourself updated with what&#39;s being taught at school and speak with the teachers regularly to understand your child&rsquo;s weaknesses. This way you can concentrate on those areas. Also, you can make sure you teach the same topics at home as well, complimenting what&#39;s been taught at school to help reduce any learning conflicts in the child&rsquo;s mind.<br />
<br />
<strong>3. Don&rsquo;t get too competitive</strong><br />
Every child is different and has his own unique personality. As parents, it&#39;s best not to compare your child with any other child even if it&#39;s their own siblings. This is sure to build some unnecessary pressure on the child and hamper his performance.<br />
<br />
The focus should be on making sure they learn and enhance their knowledge and not get bogged down with competing with others.<br />
<br />
<strong>4. Appoint a good tutor </strong><br />
It becomes difficult for some parents to dedicate a lot of time to their child&rsquo;s studies due to multiple reasons. But being involved can help you at least recognize the areas where your child needs help. In Singapore, there are several PSLE tutors who can help your child enhance their skills in those areas.<br />
<br />
<a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/psle-tuition"">Good tutors</a> are available for all the subjects English, Mother Tongue Language, Maths and Science. Being the subject matter experts they can help lay a strong foundation for that subject by clarifying the basic concepts. Tuitions are not only for weak students but for everyone as it&rsquo;s a great way for students to practice their learning.<br />
<br />
<strong>5. Encourage participation in co-curricular activities </strong><br />
All work and no play make Jack a dull boy. Encourage your child to participate in co-curricular activities in school as well as outside school. Playing sports or learning a musical instrument helps them stimulate their mind and improve their concentration levels. Also, involve them in the household chores like everyone else in the house. All this would take their mind off from the exam and reduce the stress level.<br />
<br />
<strong>6. Prepare them for the future </strong><br />
Exams come and go and your child needs to understand that their whole future is not dependent on just one exam. As parents, you need to prepare them for the worse. They should learn to handle failures and know that it&#39;s not the end of the world.<br />
<br />
There are so many different avenues available these days. Tap on your child&rsquo;s strengths and interests to guide them in the right direction. Prepare your child to embrace the future with an open and positive mind. Learning life skills is even more important than doing well in academics to prosper in life.</span></span></span></span><br />

<br />
The scoring system for PSLE is going to changes from 2021 from T-score to Achievement levels (ALs). Achievement levels are divided into 8 score bands with AL1 being the highest and AL8 the lowest.<br />
<br />
Students will be given an AL for each subject based on their raw score. The sum of the ALs will form the total PSLE score, ranging from 4 to 32, where 4 would be the best score. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman,serif""><span style=""font-size:16px"">Students will no longer be given a comparative score and awarded scores solely based on their performance. Through this scoring system, the focus is more on evaluating the student&#39;s understanding of the subject rather than how well she/he has done compared to her/his peers.<br />
<br />
But regardless of the scoring system, students should only focus on giving their best. Even for parents, the scoring system should make no difference in providing the support your child needs.<br />
<br />
The tips we have shared above are sure to bring out the best in your child not only in PSLE but in every exam they give. </span></span></p>","1","2020-04-23","2021-03-02 18:26:05"

<p><span style=""color:#000000"">In a study conducted by the National University of Singapore -&nbsp;</span><u><a href=""https://www.fas.nus.edu.sg/srn/archives/60782"" target=""_blank"">Tuition has ballooned to an S$1.4b industry in Singapore.

<br />
Yes, its a&nbsp;<em>BILLION</em> dollars folks, not millions!<br />
<br />
This amount consist of fees paid to tuition centres, private tutors and enrichment centres. Why are we spending so much? And is tuition really needed?</span></p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><span style=""color:#000000""><a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/request-tutor"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""Is A Tutor Necessary? Yes"" src=""https://tutorcity.sg/admin_tutor/attachments/uploads/Your_learning_journey_with_tutor_city.png"" style=""border-style:solid; border-width:1px; height:280px; width:380px"" /></a></span></p>

<p><span style=""color:#000000""><strong>Here are 6 reasons why tuition is necessary in Singapore</strong><br />
<br />
1. A tutor can share certain knowledge or techniques that may not be taught in sufficient details during normal school hours. The tutor can also answer questions which your child may be too <strong>embarrassed</strong> to ask in school.<br />
<br />
2. A tutor can <strong>identify the weak areas</strong> of each student and focus on teaching these specific areas which a school teacher is unable to do due to the high student-teacher ratio.<br />
<br />
3. A tutor can impart <strong>street smart methodologies</strong> to tackle exam questions, identify topics to focus on and tips on how to remember certain formulas.<br />
<br />
4. The main advantage of home tuition is the <strong>one-to-one </strong>attention. With one-to-one tutor to student ratio, the tutor will pay specific attention on your child&rsquo;s weak areas and apply the appropriate teaching methods or solutions.<br />
<br />
5 Getting a home tutor would mean <strong>less travelling time </strong>as the tuition is conducted at the student&rsquo;s home. The time spent travelling could be better invested in studying a bit longer, preparing for lessons or resting after a long day at school.<br />
<br />
6. Home tuition schedule is also more <strong>flexible</strong> and easier to customise as compared to a tuition centre which have fixed timetables.<br />

<strong>How can tuition improve my child&#39;s grades?</strong><br />
<br />
In order for the tuition to be most effective, it is important to set goals that are realistic which the child is willing and able to achieve. Do not expect your child to achieve As when he or she is currently failing the subject. Set a target, for example, improve the grades from a D to a B or C.<br />
<br />
Do not expect miracles to happen overnight. Give the tutor and student 1-2 months before expecting to see any significant results.<br />
With constant monitoring of your child&rsquo;s progress and setting of realistic targets, the return on investment in your child&rsquo;s tuition can be maximised to the fullest.<br />
<br />
This decision ultimately affects your&nbsp;child&#39;s future educational path and prospects to a better career. <u><a href=""https://tutorcity.sg"">Home tutors</a></u> can bring many kinds of benefits that are not obvious enough.<br />
<br />
<strong>How can I find a good tutor?</strong><br />
<br />
Seeking the help of tuition agencies is one way to find a good tutor. This is where Tutor City can assist you to find the most suitable tutor for your child.<br />
<br />
The commission of the tutor matching is taken from the tutor&#39;s first month tuition fees, therefore this tutor matching service comes at virtually <strong>no cost to the you at all</strong>.<br />
<br />
Here&rsquo;s what we do: take down the child education requirements needs, share with you the <u><a href=""https://tutorcity.sg/tuition-rates"">tuition rates</a></u> based on your budget, provide advice on the number of sessions and length of session required, which in turn depends on the number of subjects to be tutored upon.<br />
<br />
Generally, a 2 hrs weekly session is necessary if your child requires tutoring in one or two subjects (toggle 2 subjects for each session). Any increase in subjects will probably a tutoring schedule of 2 sessions a week at either 1.5 or 2 hours per session.<br />
<br />
Once we have your requirements, we will then contact the short-listed tutors in our database list to see whether the tutor is interested in taking up your tutoring assignment. It can take up to an hour to a few days to confirm on your assignment, depending on the complexity of your requirements. A primary school <u><a href=""https://tutorcity.sg/english-tuition"">English tutor</a></u> is much easier to find compared to a JC level <u><a href=""https://tutorcity.sg/maths-tuition"">Mathematics tutor</a></u>.<br />
<br />
We do encourage our tutors to upload their certificates when they register for <u><a href=""https://tutorcity.sg/register-as-tutor"">tuition assignments</a></u>&nbsp;for parents to view and tutors would have to bring their original certificates on the first day of lesson. This is to verify their credentials and educational background before they provide the tuition.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">1. Guest blogging allows you to reach your target audience.&nbsp;</span></span></span></strong></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">This is probably the number one advantage of guest blogging. If you own a website your primary objective is to attract your target audience to this website and <a href=""https://www.guestblogging.pro/high-domain-authority-dofollow-backlinks-sites-list"" target=""_blank"">generate organic online traffic</a>.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">It will only take you several hours to do your research and to write a high-quality blog post. But once it has been published on somebody else&rsquo;s website it will exist there indefinitely so people will be able to find you through it forever.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">On average a guest blogger can get between 500 to 2000 visitors to their own site from one such blog post. However, this number can be much higher depending on the host who publishes your work.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">It is also noteworthy that people who click on your website through your guest blog post do so because they are genuinely interested in what you have to say, they are not just clicking on the link randomly. So the <strong>quality of online traffic</strong> you receive from guest blogging is much higher.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">Data shows that approximately 90% of visitors who simply stumble upon a website while surfing the net <a href=""https://www.crazyegg.com/blog/why-users-leave-a-website/"" target=""_blank"">click off after just a few seconds</a>. Whereas those visitors who found a website from a guest blog post spend approximately five minutes on the website and the bounce rate is considerably lower (only about 40%).</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><strong><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">2. Create backlinks that lead back to your website.&nbsp;</span></span></span></strong></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">Usually, if you are invited to write a guest blog post for a website the host will give you a small column next to the post which is called the author&#39;s bio.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">If you don&#39;t know what are backlinks and its benefits, read <a href=""https://backlinko.com/hub/seo/backlinks"" target=""_blank"">Brian Dean&#39;s guide</a>.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">This is where you can provide the audience with a link that leads back to your own website. Not only does this link help your audience find your website thus increasing your organic online traffic, but having multiple backlinks out there on the web will also improve the SEO ranking of the site overall.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">Also, you might include backlinks leading to your other posts within the actual article. But do keep in mind that you are not allowed to include links for the actual products you sell only the links for blog pages.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">3. Building a network of influential bloggers.&nbsp;</span></span></span></strong></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">Guest blogging also allows you to create and fortify personal relationships with other bloggers in your niche. Some of these bloggers might have tens of thousands or even millions of readers so being featured on their webpage will definitely give your site a boost.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">You can make the first step towards building a relationship with the other bloggers by liking their social media pages, leaving comments on their blog posts, and tweeting about their work.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">But do not underestimate the importance of networking with smaller bloggers as well. In the end, the more active you are online the more exposure you will get and the more successful your website will be.</span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">4. Guest blogging improves your brand awareness.&nbsp;</span></span></span></strong></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">If you own a company then guest blogging is definitely something you should try as it will increase your brand awareness and allow you to reach new customers.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">Let&rsquo;s say for example, that you wrote a guest post for a website that is visited by approximately 20,000 people daily. Even if your post is ignored by most of them and is viewed by only by 3000 of them you might get approximately 300 visitors to your own website from this single post. And some of these visitors are bound to turn into paying customers.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">In addition, 3000 people have been exposed to your brand so even if they do not buy anything from you right now they might do so in the future when they come across your brand for the second or third time.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">5. Guest blogging increases your social media following.&nbsp;</span></span></span></strong></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">People who find your website via backlinks included in your guest blog post might want to follow you on various social media if they really like what you have written.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">Every <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/tutorcitysg/"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> or <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/tutorcitysg/"" target=""_blank"">Instagram</a> comment every retweet and subscription to your YouTube channel serves to promote your brand awareness and subsequently your sales.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">Also, if your audience really likes what you have written then they will share your content on their own social media pages and this will, of course, allow you to reach even more people.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size:18px"">If you are an expert in a field and an avid blogger then guest blogging is one of the best ways to <strong>improve your authority online</strong>.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">When you write a blog post for others and popular websites agree to publish it that shows a high level of trust and indicates that you are a true professional who truly knows what they are talking about. </span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">Why is trust important and how do you calculate it -&nbsp;visit the <a href=""https://majestic.com/"" target=""_blank"">Majestic site</a> for more information</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">When people see that the blog host trust you, they start viewing you in a positive light which will undoubtedly reflect well on your own personal brand as well as your business. Establishing credibility and gaining your audience&#39;s trust is essential for turning readers into customers and being featured on other people&rsquo;s blogs can help you do all of that.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">On the other hand, you should be careful not to get affiliated with an untrustworthy host and website. So if you are offered a chance to host a guest blogger (or become one) do not just jump at the opportunity, do some research first to find out what the audience thinks about your prospective collaborator. A good reputation is fragile and you should tread carefully online to maintain it.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><strong><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size:18px"">6. You will improve your writing skills and get valuable feedback from the audience.&nbsp;</span></strong></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">Guest blogging is especially beneficial for new bloggers who want to hone their writing skills. When you write a blog post for somebody else you have to check it, then double-check it and triple-check it to make sure that all of the vocabulary and grammar is on point. Otherwise, your reputation as a writer will suffer and you will not be invited back.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">But the blog owners are not the only ones providing feedback on your writing, far more important is the feedback provided by your audience.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">By listening to constructive criticism and taking their feedback into consideration you will become a better blogger. If you are only writing for people who regularly visit your website then you have no incentive to push yourself out of your comfort zone and learn new techniques.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">Whereas when you are writing a guest blog post for somebody else&rsquo;s website you have to tweak your writing style to suit their audience. So writing a guest blog post is a valuable educational experience.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><strong><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size:18px"">7. Guest blogging allows you to build the search engine authority and the domain authority.&nbsp;</span></strong></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">By creating multiple guest blog posts and adding backlinks to your own website you are improving your website&#39;s SEO, namely the <a href=""https://moz.com/learn/seo/domain-authority"" target=""_blank"">domain authority measured by Moz</a> which is crucial in ranking your website.&nbsp;Eventually, your hard work will pay off and hopefully, your website will end up on the first page of Google.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">Whenever ordinary people search for something they rarely venture past the first page (some people do not even look past the first five or six results) so the more guest blog post you write and the more backlinks you generate the higher the chance of ending up with the top ranking.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><strong><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size:18px"">8. Keeping your website up-to-date.&nbsp;</span></strong></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">Guest blogging is not just beneficial for writers it is also immensely useful for brand owners who want to keep their website up-to-date with all the latest information and know-how.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">Due to a lack of time, the brand owners might not have the chance (or the necessary expertise) to write every single blog post by themselves.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">So if you own a blog that caters to a specific niche instead of spending your valuable time writing all the blog post on your own why not invite some industry experts to do it for you? They will get valuable exposure and you will get fresh content for your blog; it is a win-win situation!&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">If your website is popular there is no reason for the bloggers to refuse your offer. However, even if you are not that well-known yet you might still interest them with a unique subject matter; there is no harm in asking.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><strong><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size:18px"">9. Guest blogging boosts your social media shares.&nbsp;</span></strong></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">We have already mentioned social media likes and comments however let&rsquo;s go deeper into another (and perhaps the most important) aspect of social media: <strong>sharing</strong>.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">People are always keen to share some useful information they have discovered on the internet and if your article is engaging and contains a lot of useful information then your readers will certainly recommend it to their friends. </span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">This is the type of high-quality <strong>word-of-mouth advertising</strong> money can&rsquo;t buy. Every time somebody clicks the share button you gain access to more prospective customers, however, if you are particularly lucky you might even catch some celebrity&rsquo;s or social media influencers&rsquo; eye. One endorsement from them will boost your credibility (and consequently your sales) tremendously.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><strong><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size:18px"">10. Guest blogging provides an excellent ROI (return on investment).&nbsp;</span></strong></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">Nowadays brands spend thousands of dollars on online advertisements to promote themselves and their products. <strong>Guest blogging</strong> is one of the cheapest alternatives to that. Although it cannot entirely replace the online advertising industry, it is certainly an excellent addition to it. In fact, if you are a blogger the main investment here is your time.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">Spending just a few hours of your day on creating a high-quality blog post will potentially attract thousands of readers who can be converted into dozens of paying customers.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">And if you have a successful website and you wish to host guest bloggers on it there is really no downside for you. All you need to do is invest a bit of time into reaching out to your desired bloggers and voila! You will have fresh content, organic traffic, and a better SEO ranking.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">And one more advantage of guest blogging is that you are able to compete with the big companies in the manner you are not able to when it comes to investing money in <a href=""https://ads.google.com/home/"" target=""_blank"">online advertising</a>.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">It does not matter whether you are a small brand, if your article is of better quality it will rank higher on Google. So you are being rewarded with success based on the quality of your work and not based on how much cash you put into ads.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><strong><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size:18px"">Final Words</span></strong></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size:18px"">To conclude, guest blogging is immensely beneficial for both individual bloggers as well as commercial brands. It gives bloggers an opportunity to hone their writing skills to reach out to new audiences; the hosts benefit by keeping their blogs up-to-date and providing their readers with valuable information from industry experts.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">Guest blogging also presents a cost-effective supplement to your online advertising campaign; it helps attract <a href=""https://ahrefs.com/blog/seo-metrics/#section7"" target=""_blank"">organic traffic</a> and prospective customers to your website.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">And these are just some of the top benefits. No matter which niche your blog caters to you will benefit from guest blogging.</span></span></span></p>

<span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">Higher Chinese is an optional subject offered to primary level and secondary level students. The intention by the <a href=""https://www.moe.gov.sg/"" style=""color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline"" target=""_blank"">Ministry of Education</a> is to enable students with aptitude, interest and proficiency in Chinese to raise their standards by learning at a higher level and increasing cultural knowledge via Higher Chinese education.</span></span></span></p>

<br />
<span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">For Secondary students taking the O level Higher Chinese, there is an emphasis on writing, thus in Paper 1 there are 2 compositions (writing an email and 1 essay). For Paper 2, it will be comprehension and summary.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:center""><span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif""><a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/chinese-tuition"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""Mastering Higher Chinese"" src=""https://tutorcity.sg/admin_tutor/attachments/uploads/Mastering_Higher_Chinese.png"" style=""border-style:solid; border-width:1px; height:250px; width:380px"" /></a></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><strong><span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">When is Higher Chinese offered?</span></span></span></strong><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">It depends on the school, most schools offer Higher Chinese at Primary 5 level which students can opt-in. However, some schools offer it as young as in Primary 2 level e.g. St. Hilda&rsquo;s Primary school.</span></span></span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">What are the requirements for Higher Chinese?</span></span></span></strong><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">Majority of the primary schools will let you opt in higher Chinese if you got 70 marks and above at primary 4 standard Chinese. Interestingly, there was an article in 2014 where <a href=""http://97 marks was not good enough to qualify for Higher Chinese"" target=""_blank"">97 marks was not good enough to qualify for Higher Chinese</a>.<br />
<br />
For Secondary level,&nbsp; the top&nbsp;11-30% of the cohort who scored A* grade for Chinese or&nbsp; at least a Merit in the Higher Chinese for PSLE will be eligible to take Higher Chinese in secondary school. On top of these, those ranked in the top 10% of the PSLE are also eligible for Higher Chinese.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm"">Is the workload higher in Higher Chinese?</p>

<p>To prepare for tests, the higher Chinese students from SAP schools like RGS, VS, SCGS had to memorise large volumes of texts and phrases, on top of the normal&nbsp;å¬å&nbsp; and æè¯­&nbsp;(idioms) which they are regularly tested on.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
They have to face long comprehension passages and deal with the summary section in Paper 2, which require a strong arsenal of vocabulary to paraphrase the points. The close passage (éè¯å¡«ç©º) is also difficult to guess and students struggle in this area too.</p>

<p>Thus, there are more grounds to cover as compared to normal Chinese, your child would have to be mentally prepared for this.<br />
<br />

<br />
<span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">Primary students benefit from taking Higher Chinese at PSLE if they are applying to enter a SAP / IP secondary school. In addition, you will gain a more solid foundation in the language so it&#39;s less of a struggle when the student continue to take Higher Chinese in secondary school, and IP secondary schools make it compulsory for all students to take Higher Mother Tongue.</span></span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">From 2021, there will be a change in the <a href=""http://www.moe.gov.sg/microsites/psle/PSLE%20Scoring/psle-scoring.html"">PSLE Scoring</a> system. Students will be graded using Achievement Levels of 1 to 8 (Refer to Infographic).&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">Students who did well in Higher Chinese looking to get into <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Assistance_Plan"">Special Assistance Plan (SAP) schools</a> will also be given a posting advantage in the new system, thus the advantage is also retained for students to take Higher Chinese at PSLE.</span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">Secondary students who took Higher Chinese at O Levels are exempted from taking Mother Tongue if they progress to Junior College. Students who didn&rsquo;t take Higher Chinese are required to study Chinese as an additional subject for A-levels. i.e. <a href=""http://www.seab.gov.sg/home/examinations/gce-a-level/a-level-syllabuses-examined-for-school-candidates-2020"">H1 Chinese</a>. Thus, these students who are exempted would have a lighter workload over the course of 2 years in Junior College..</span></span></span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">Should I take Normal Chinese or Higher Chinese?</span></span></span></strong><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">If you or your child displays a keen interest in Chinese Language and Culture and you are planning to enrol into an IP school or SAP school, then yes you should take Higher Chinese.</span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""color:null""><span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">For example, if your child enjoys watching Channel 8 or U programmes or reading Chinese articles on social media or fiction books and literature, he / she already has the basics in place. Another factor is whether or not your child is keen to write in Chinese journals or blogs in Chinese online, that points to a higher level of proficiency in the language. All the more you should consider getting your child into the Higher Chinese program.</span></span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">However, if you or your child displays a poor foundation in Chinese from primary level and doesn&rsquo;t enjoy studying it, there is no point forcing him / her to study at an even more difficult level and making life miserable. Remember that O level has 7-9 subjects for your child to handle and Higher Chinese is a demanding subject which can be avoided.<br />

How do you help your child get better in Maths? Read on","improve maths,tips for maths,maths tips,maths,mathematics,math","Improve_Your_Maths_With_These_5_Easy_Steps.png","<p><br />
<strong><em>Why do kids fear maths?</em></strong><br />
<br />
The usual answer given is that it is very hard to understand and it makes them feel stupid. Parents all say that they want their children to learn. Yet when it comes to maths they seem to have a problem with it, and parents are not able to help.<br />
<br />
<strong>How can you&nbsp;improve&nbsp;Maths skills?</strong><br />
<br />
<span style=""color:#8e44ad"">1. Start As Early As Possible</span><br />
<br />
Introducing maths should begin when the child is young. The later it is taught, the more difficult the teaching will be and the quicker they will grow out of the subject. It is not only the preschool teacher who should encourage this but parents, and other family members, should also take part in teaching the child mathematics. In the longer term the child should develop a love of mathematics as it will help them to have more self confidence in the subject.<br />
<br />
You can start with using math games such as puzzles and quizzes that many apps and online games are available to help you teach your child. These games will be very easy for the child to play and to understand and will help them to reach an elementary level of maths very quickly. When you encourage mathematics at this early stage of life, it can teach the child many important skills and give them a good grounding in maths before any serious learning takes place.</p>

<p><span style=""color:#8e44ad"">2. Step-by-Step Process</span><br />
<br />
Teach them how to use numbers and learn how to make graphs and charts to show them the process of learning math. Teach them the various steps of the process, and let them watch you do the math yourself. Allow them to see the process of learning it, so they will have a better understanding of how the process works.<br />
<br />
Also, don&#39;t be afraid to use your own ideas when teaching math. This will encourage them to do better, and it is really helpful to know what it is you are doing so you can show them!<br />
<br />
<span style=""color:#8e44ad"">3. Practice Makes Perfect</span><br />
<br />
Regular practice always work!<br />
One of the more important things you can do for your child is to keep encouraging them to practice on a daily basis, using worksheets, assessment books or other schools exam-papers. Keep working at math, and you will see improvement over time.<br />
<br />
Start out slowly, and work with them until they get used to what you are doing. By starting with small problems, you can progress very quickly. This can be done, with your child, by having them practice problems from home or by having them solve some problems that are related to their schoolwork.<br />
<br />
<span style=""color:#8e44ad"">4 Engage Private Tutors</span><br />
<br />
You can learn more by talking to other teachers, so if you want to send your child to private math classes in tuition centres, go for it! Or you can hire a private math tutor to take up the task of helping you teach math to your child. It is a lot easier to let someone else to do the job because as a parent, you will lose your temper easily from your higher expectations. Hiring a 3rd party is a better way to help your child with their math skills.<br />
<br />
<span style=""color:#8e44ad"">5. Use Maths to solve real-life problems</span><br />
<br />
You need to show the relevance and importance of maths in real-life situations, how maths can connect to the world around us and the concepts that can apply to solve practical problems.<br />
<br />
It could be that it helps you with your work at work, or at school or even just your home life. What you need to realize is that your understanding of numbers and graphs and formulas can actually help you in all areas of your life.<br />
<br />
For example, maths is used in the design and configuration process in Info-Technology, mechanical engineering and mobile apps. Do you want to be the next inventor of cars, or the next software creator for computers, or the next person who discovers how to make the next iPhone?<br />
<br />
So, how to apply math to real life starts with being informed consumers and getting educated on the subject. As you learn more about math, you&#39;ll discover that there are so many ways that you can apply it in your daily life. The ability to use numbers and graphs and formulas in your everyday life is invaluable. It is a skill that you can use for both your professional and personal life.<br />

<strong>How to improve my child&rsquo;s Math PSLE?</strong><br />
<br />
In 2019, there was a backlash over the difficulty level faced by Primary 6 students: <a href=""https://www.tnp.sg/news/singapore/parents-upset-psle-maths-paper-leaves-pupils-tears"" target=""_blank"">Parents upset as PSLE maths paper leaves pupils in tears</a><br />
<br />
With such tough questions awaiting this year&#39;s students, there is only 6&nbsp;months left to the 2020 <a href=""https://www.seab.gov.sg/home/examinations/psle"" target=""_blank"">PSLE exam</a>. This year is very unique because of the Covid-19 pandemic, schools were closed in the 2nd Quarter and students have to change to Home-Based Learning in order to continue with their preparation for PSLE.<br />
<br />
With such a chaotic situation disrupting the normal mode of learning, how will parents and students get ready to sit for the PSLE Maths exam? We have just the perfect guide that you can use, read our best tips for PSLE Math revision.<br />
<br />
<span style=""color:#8e44ad"">1. Understand your child&rsquo;s weak areas</span><br />
<br />
Parents should start from the basics and find out which areas they are particularly weak in. For example, if you know your child struggles in addition, then try dividing their task down into smaller sections. The more hours they can spend doing one section of their work, the better. Once you know how to find out my child&#39;s weak areas in maths, you can then start working on each of these areas, one at a time.<br />
<br />
This will help you focus on your child&#39;s weaknesses, and at the same time improve on their strengths. You can also introduce your child to various methods that will help them find their weak points. There are quite a few free online games and math worksheets that you can use as an introduction to areas that might have them struggling. If you start early, then you can provide your child with plenty of ways to solve problems that they might struggle with.<br />
<br />
<span style=""color:#8e44ad"">2. Focus on key topics</span><br />
<br />
There are some topics that your child cannot avoid and has to master them to do well in PSLE Math. Topics such as fractions, percentage and ratios are commonly sprinkled throughout the papers and you need to know the proper conversion methods from fractions to ratios, percentages to fractions etc.<br />
<br />
For Algebra, your child has to know how to calculate areas and perimeters of the different shapes (circles, squares, triangles), finding the unknown angle and concept of overlapping. It is also good to know the PSLE format and scoring so you can allocate the time required for each paper.&nbsp;(See infographic)</p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/maths-tuition"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""2019 PSLE Math exam paper format"" src=""https://tutorcity.sg/admin_tutor/attachments/uploads/The_2019_PSLE_Math_exam_paper_format.png"" style=""border-style:solid; border-width:1px; height:1200px; width:480px"" /></a></p>

<p><span style=""color:#8e44ad"">3. Problem Sums &ndash; Methods to Solve</span><br />
<br />
The Math Model method holds the key to solving problem sums for Maths PSLE. It is sometimes compulsory in certain questions to use this method to get a solution and if your child fails to show this, their marks will be deducted. Many parents use Algebra to solve problem sums and have difficulties in using this method to teach their kids so they cannot help any further.<br />
<br />
The model method involves the use of building blocks to solve questions by splitting into several parts that are connected to one another by various relationships. To understand more, you can learn from <a href=""https://www.koobits.com/2012/11/06/techniques-for-learning-the-singapore-math-model-method"" target=""_blank"">Koobits: Techniques For Learning The Singapore Math Model Method</a>.<br />
<br />
<span style=""color:#8e44ad"">4. Time Management</span><br />
<br />
This is crucial as you only have 1 hour for Paper 1 and 1 hour 30 minutes for Paper 2. There is simply no time to be wasted!<br />
<br />
Parents need to drill into their kids that you cannot get stuck and get overly engrossed into solving a question, ignoring the rest which may be easier to complete. During practice sessions at home, time your children when they do other schools exam papers and watch them closely. Doing so will improve your children&rsquo;s time management skills.<br />
<br />
<span style=""color:#8e44ad"">5. Get Intensive Lessons</span><br />
<br />
If you need help to have crash course to quickly go through your child&rsquo;s weak topics, enrol into a tuition centre or engage a&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/psle-tuition"" target=""_blank"">PSLE&nbsp;tutor</a>. Tutor City&rsquo;s specialist maths tutors can teach you how to break down complex problem sums into simpler, solvable steps.</p>

<p><strong>How to get A1 for O-level Maths?</strong><br />
<br />
<span style=""color:#8e44ad"">1. Know the format and syllabus</span><br />
<br />
You have to know the format and weightage so that you can plan how much time to spend on each question and paper.<br />
<br />
Paper 1 (2 hours) : Consist of 11 to 13 questions, 80 marks, 44% of total weightage<br />
Paper 2 (2 &amp; half hours): Consist of 9 to 11 questions, 100 marks, 56% of total weightage<br />
<br />
Some of the key topics tested for <a href=""https://www.seab.gov.sg/home/examinations/gce-o-level"" target=""_blank"">O-level</a> E-Math are Algebra (Numbers, Ratio, Percentage, Rate and Speed, etc). Geometry (Angles, Congruence, Pythagoras&rsquo; theorem, etc) and Statistics (Data Analysis, Probability)</p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/o-level-tuition"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""How to get A1 for O level Maths"" src=""https://tutorcity.sg/admin_tutor/attachments/uploads/How_to_get_A1_for_O_level_Maths.png"" style=""border-style:solid; border-width:1px; height:1040px; width:480px"" /></a></p>

<p><span style=""color:#8e44ad"">2. Meeting exam requirements</span><br />
<br />
Always put the workings in a step by step manner, in the center of the paper, when you answer each question. Don&rsquo;t assume that the marker will find your scribbles at the side of the paper and take it that you got the answer correctly. The workings have to be progressive and don&rsquo;t miss out any steps.<br />
<br />
Paying attention to the nitty-gritty will mean the difference between an A1 and A2, or A2 and B3. Many students lost marks because they misread the fine details of a question, or skip a working in the answer. For example, if the final answer allows a rounding up or down to nearest hundred or thousand, make sure you follow it! It is not always the default 3 significant figures.<br />
<br />
Be strategic &ndash; always answer the first part of each question which is usually the easiest even if there are only 1 or 2 marks. Don&rsquo;t get stuck on the later parts and move on to the next question, then do the same thing to get the 1 or 2 marks rather than waste them on questions you won&rsquo;t be able to solve.<br />
<br />
<span style=""color:#8e44ad"">3. Create your own notes and summaries</span><br />
<br />
Making your own notes with your own words makes recalling them a lot easier as you will understand what you have recorded before. Your teacher&rsquo;s or tutor&rsquo;s materials and resources would have accumulated to a large pile of papers by now, you will definitely not be able to remember where to find a particular formula or answer.<br />
<br />
You will need to make a formula sheet of what you need to use during the exam, because the exam&rsquo;s sheet don&rsquo;t have the full list and you will need to ensure you have the correct formulas on hand.<br />
<br />
<span style=""color:#8e44ad"">4. Put in a lot of effort to practice</span><br />
<br />
You will need to put in the time and effort to practice, no shortcut to this.<br />
<br />
Practice makes perfect, so they say, and it holds true for mastering mathematics.<br />
<br />
Going through the 10 year series and past years exam papers will definitely help you to identify the common questions asked repeatedly over the years, with the difference being the values placed in the questions. By perfecting the steps, workings, formulas used, you will be able to answer the O level exam questions confidently as you will have done the same many times over during your practice sessions.<br />
<br />
<span style=""color:#8e44ad"">5. Ask for assistance from others</span><br />
<br />
If there are topics you find difficult to understand despite constant practice and tries, get your teacher, tutor or a friend to explain to you in their own way. Alternatively, you can go online to download model answers from other students / teachers whose resources may be better or simpler to understand.</p>","1","2020-05-07","2020-05-13 11:07:33"

With this backdrop, every educational institute was advised to shift towards the &#39;&#39;Home-Based Learning&#39;&#39; throughout the country so that the students can carry on learning until the state can again engage itself in regular schooling activities.<br />
<br />
Should this hiatus be a cause of any break in our educational persuasion? Let&#39;s find out.<br />
<br />
Most of our educational institutes in our country are already enriched with excellent technological advancements and the necessary expertise to be conducive to the students for making &#39;&#39;Home-Based Learning&#39;&#39; a success through online learning. Besides, not only our schools and universities are rich in online technology, Singapore is a country renowned worldwide for providing customized professional tuition services required by the students every once in a while.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:16px""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">You can get proficient services from a number of tuition providing centers but JC Physics, Maths, Chemistry Tuition&nbsp;and <a href=""https://www.thephysicscafe.com"" target=""_blank"">Secondary Physics, Maths, Chemistry Tuition</a> are among the most successful ones. So, in essence, it wouldn&#39;t be of any concern to any student or their parents that they are currently forbidden to attend schools or universities.<br />
<br />
But getting the most out of something new requires time and practice. Even if a student considers himself as techno-savvy, frequently, he might find it challenging to be benefited from <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/blog/how-online-tutors-can-help-you-with-your-assignment-or-studies"" target=""_blank"">online learning.</a> If that&#39;s the case for you too, please carry on reading about 7 Tips for a Better Online Learning during Covid-19 outbreak period:&nbsp;</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:22px""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif""><strong>1: Create Your &#39;&#39;Sanctum Sanctuary.</strong></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:16px""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">When I was a student, it seemed like a million years ago; I used to study at our dining table. As I had three other siblings with about a 3-year age gap and very meager earning by our working-class parents, ours was home with little space.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:center""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:16px""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif""><img alt=""student with dog"" src=""https://tutorcity.sg/admin_tutor/attachments/uploads/studentwithdog.jpg"" style=""border-style:solid; border-width:1px; height:252px; width:380px"" /></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:16px""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">You might be in the same situation, or you might have the things that millions out there in the world, would be grateful to have. No matter where you stand in the social order, it is an absolute must for you to have a designated place for study, online or no online studying. This goes a long way for helping the students to settle in quickly.<br />
<br />
As soon as you are settled in, have a suitable desk with all the necessary hard wire. Make sure your hard drive has enough space, your headphones work correctly, you have steady data service, etc. All the textbooks and study materials with the requisite stationeries should be available at your fingertip. You can decorate your study room to make it more personalized so that you can feel relaxed all the time.</span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:16px"">You might be living in a confined or shared space, but that should not stop you from claiming an area of your own. Your requested space can be in the corner of the kitchen, or the family dining table can also be a suitable alternative. You need to make the other members aware of the designated place. If you can achieve all of those, you are ready to go with a complete focus for better online learning. Now you need to keep the place tidy.<br />
<br />
<strong>2: Plan Carefully to Create A Routine That You Can Follow:</strong><br />
<br />
When you have a place that you are comfortable studying, you need a well-thought-out plan. The person who knows best about yourself is you, so you should be the executioner of your study routine. If you are an early morning person, critical issues should be dealt with early on since you know when you don&#39;t feel like doing anything substantial, set aside blocks of time for that period when you can goofing around to make yourself relaxed.<br />
<br />
Once you have the basic idea of how you are going to spend your time, create a routine that you know you can follow, that you are comfortable with, that you know, will enable you to get the best use of your time. This is one of the benefits of online learning because you can plan the tutorial of the hardest subject in your most energetic time.<br />
<br />
<strong>3: Keep the Disruptions to A Minimum:</strong><br />
<br />
The world we are living in now is a connected one. And this connection, be it the social media, video feeds, online gaming, trending YouTube videos, etc. can be a disruption in the disguise of fun. And then there is the overload of information about absolutely anything insignificant circling around is another surefire way to shoot your concentration to pieces. You need to treat them as what they are &ndash; like disruptions &ndash; and assign them their proper place where they belong &ndash; like way beyond your brain where they won&#39;t be able to disrupt.<br />
<br />
The first strike will be straightforward but very effective; keep your phone out of your sight while you are in an online learning session. Or better yet, leave it out of your reach for the entire time you plan to study. This will help you stop procrastinating.<br />

<strong>4: Use The Video Lectures to Your Advantage:</strong></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:center""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:16px""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif""><img alt=""couple with mobile"" src=""https://tutorcity.sg/admin_tutor/attachments/uploads/couplewithmobiles.jpg"" style=""border-style:solid; border-width:1px; height:214px; width:380px"" /></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:16px"">While in session, your priority should be getting the most out of the <a href=""https://elearningindustry.com/the-8-best-free-video-tools-for-teachers"" target=""_blank"">video lecture</a> you possibly can. While in secondary school, my private tutor once said that a student could mostly give money to a teacher for his time, but what a teacher can give to a student is immeasurable. This works even in the unique setting of an online learning session. I believe if you follow simple, elementary rules, you would be immensely benefited.<br />
<br />
First off, let your instructor decide when he/she will be comfortable giving lectures, and you follow the schedule to the letter. Asking questions always helps, so whenever you feel the need, don&#39;t hesitate. It also helps the teacher to connect with you more helpfully.<br />
<br />
And you should always take notes as the lecture carries on because later when the session is finished, you will find many issues that seem beyond your grasp, but notes about them by your handwriting will make them simpler.<br />
<br />
<strong>5: Stop Multitasking:</strong><br />
<br />
As the Coronavirus pandemic&nbsp;is making you study alone and in a more self-directing way, you might find it challenging to stop multitasking while the online session is on.<br />
<br />
So, if you think of listening to music while checking Instagram when the course is running in full swing, you are only damaging your chance to proceed with your studies. Also, you are wasting your precious time and hard-earned money. I firmly believe that multitasking only hurts everything that you are trying and making you inefficient slowly. It is just swinging your attention back and forth and hitting nothing.</span></span></p>

<span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:16px""><strong>6: Online Discussions Help:</strong><br />
<br />
Online discussion with the classmates about the topic of the online session before or after is constructive. Because you are talking with people who are more or less in the same position in the study track as you are in right now. So, you probably will have similar issues that are keeping you from apprehending a particular topic. When you discuss that and share and be shared thoughts regarding the problem, it is highly likely that you will find something helpful.<br />
<br />
<strong>7: Break Is Important: </strong><br />
<br />
Believe it or not &ndash; taking regular breaks helps. So don&#39;t hesitate to take them while the online session is on, but also be smart enough to make the best use of them. You can stretch your legs, have a cup of coffee or eat a donut &ndash; anything that helps you bring your concentration back.<br />
<br />
There you go. You now have my seven best tips for Better Online Learning during the Covid-19 outbreak period. Here I also want to mention that Covid-19 will not prevail. The world has faced numerous devastating forces in the past, and every single time, it bounced back. This time will be no different.

<span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif""><strong><span style=""color:#0e101a"">1. Getting started</span></strong></span></span><br />
<span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif""><span style=""color:#0e101a"">Zoom is an intuitive program, and it&rsquo;s better to become familiar with the platform to get the most out of it. To get started, do the following:&nbsp;</span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif""><span style=""color:#0e101a"">Install the software: You need to install the desktop version of Zoom for the best results and functionality. Ask your students to do the same. If some students don&rsquo;t have computers, ask them to download the Zoom mobile app on a mobile device. Before starting an online session, learn how to use the host controls, and read articles on how to do a smooth meeting in Zoom. Also, consider signing up for training and test your audio and video. Said that, make sure there is an adequate light source in front of you, not behind.</span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif""><strong><span style=""color:#0e101a"">2. Scheduling your class sessions</span></strong></span></span><br />
<span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif""><span style=""color:#0e101a"">Scheduling classes on Zoom can be done in a few different ways. We suggest you use Canvas, as Zoom is enabled in it by default. Scheduling a Zoom meeting can be done in your Canvas course, and you can set recurring meetings when needed. The URL will remain the same throughout the course. Don&rsquo;t forget to give your sessions/meeting a meaningful name. Recordings in the cloud can be automatically made available in your Canvas course site.</span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif""><strong><span style=""color:#0e101a"">3. Delegate empowering roles for students</span></strong></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif""><span style=""color:#0e101a"">Being a one-person show in Zoom online learning session can be a stressful experience. For s lesser stressful classroom management experience, consider hiring your teaching assistants (TAs) and any other teaching staff. You can make them your alternative hosts, and they&rsquo;ll be automatically added to your meetings. You can also add your TAs as co-hosts during the online sessions. Additionally, consider asking one TA or student to monitor the chat as well as to provide help to their fellow students regarding technical issues and other learning problems. That way, you can emphasize more on your teaching.</span></span></span></p>

<p><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif""><strong><span style=""color:#0e101a"">4. Developing a sense of community</span></strong></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif""><span style=""color:#0e101a"">Ask all your students to turn on video as a crucial part of class participation. That way, it will make it easier to engage with your students. If you see your students, they&rsquo;re more likely to be more attentive as they can see you. Here are some tips to make this step easier:&nbsp;</span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif""><span style=""color:#0e101a"">&bull; Make eye contact with the camera&nbsp;</span></span></span><br />
<span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif""><span style=""color:#0e101a"">&bull; Mute the microphone if you&rsquo;re not contributing</span></span></span><br />
<span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif""><span style=""color:#0e101a"">&bull; Make sure the light source is in front of you</span></span></span><br />
<span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif""><span style=""color:#0e101a"">&bull; Your speaking tone should be conversational, don&rsquo;t raise your voice</span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif""><strong><span style=""color:#0e101a"">5. Preparing for technical issues</span></strong></span></span><br />
<span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif""><span style=""color:#0e101a"">Host an introductory online meeting and ask all your students to log in, and hold discussions about getting used to the Zoom interface, and about various troubleshoots &amp; technical difficulties. Prepare a backup plan in case of unexpected issues or problems such as phone conferences, or group discussions. Ensure to inform students of the backup plan ahead so they can be prepared if technical problems occur. If you&rsquo;re using Slide ware, discuss how to share your screen with Keynote, PowerPoint, or Google Slides presentation.&nbsp;</span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif""><strong><span style=""color:#0e101a"">6. Construct a schedule</span></strong></span></span><br />
<span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif""><span style=""color:#0e101a"">Prepare a synchronous online course session just the way you would do for a traditional class. Share your schedule with students before starting the class so the students can have an informed idea about how the course will progress, what topics will be covered, and class projects/assignments they&rsquo;ll engage in. Furthermore, periodically talk about online tuition etiquettes and your expectations from the students. You can also provide a &quot;best practices&quot; document that summarizes your expectations.</span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif""><strong><span style=""color:#0e101a"">7. Record your session</span></strong></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif""><span style=""color:#0e101a"">Record all your class sessions in case any of your students want to access previous classes or study materials in the future in case they face a technical issue or can&rsquo;t attend any classes. We recommend you store all recordings on the cloud instead of on your computer. Record on the cloud is convenient and less risky. Sharing your records is also an easy affair as all you need to do is send a student the URL to the video with an interactive transcript. Zoom doesn&rsquo;t have any q</span>uotas on recordings.</span></span></p>

<br />
You know the tenses, the rules with participles and whatnot, maybe even the idioms and expressions.<br />
<br />
You&rsquo;re able to keep up a consistent conversation in English, and can even read through articles and books.<br />
<br />
But, you&rsquo;ve come across an issue: <strong>Poetry</strong><br />
<br />
Even if you have a fundamental grasp on the language itself, taking on English poetry can feel like learning a completely new language.<br />
<br />
Even for those of us who are native English speakers, there&rsquo;s so many different types and senses to poetry that makes analysing it a bit of a challenge!<br />
<br />
In particular, knowing the literary devices that make up English poetry can be difficult.</span></p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><span style=""color:#e74c3c""><em><span style=""font-size:24px"">Two such devices common in English poetry are <strong>rhythm</strong> and <strong>rhyme</strong>.</span></em></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:18px""><img alt=""Rhythm and Rhyme"" src=""https://tutorcity.sg/admin_tutor/attachments/uploads/Rhythm_and_Rhyme.png"" style=""border-style:solid; border-width:2px; height:250px; width:380px"" /></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">Though it&rsquo;s not necessarily essential to be able to identify these devices when analysing a poem&mdash;-in fact, you may even find yourself analysing a poem that does not even make use of <strong>rhythm</strong> or <strong>rhyme</strong>!&mdash;-being able to <strong>recognise</strong> the usage of these devices is important.<br />
<br />
In this article, we&rsquo;ll be going through some things to look out for using some excerpts from the poetry of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Wordsworth"" target=""_blank""><strong>William Wordsworth</strong></a>, an eighteenth/nineteenth century Romanticist poet Wordsworth.<br />
<br />
Wordsworth is a great way to hone your poetry analysis skills, and much of his work covers topics such as the relationship humans have with nature, spirituality, and industrialism - <em>which may make him the prime subject to discuss for the new curriculum&rsquo;s <a href=""https://ibpublishing.ibo.org/live-exist/rest/app/tsm.xql?doc=d_1_a1lan_tsm_1105_1a_e&amp;part=2&amp;chapter=10"" target=""_blank""><strong>Individual Oral Assessment</strong></a>.</em></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><span style=""color:#e74c3c""><span style=""font-size:22px""><strong>Rhythm and rhyme are by no means exclusive to English poetry...</strong></span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">..but the ways in which they are used are ever so slightly different than other languages. In particular, understanding the stress of certain syllables is important to understanding rhythm and rhyme in English poetry.<br />
<br />
In English, certain portions of words are more emphasized than others. For example, take the word &ldquo;emphasized!&rdquo; We pronounce the first syllable, &ldquo;em,&rdquo; a bit more than we do the &ldquo;pha&rdquo; or &ldquo;sized.&rdquo; If you yelled out &ldquo;em-PHA-sized,&rdquo; it would sound a lot more wrong than if you yelled &ldquo;EM-pha-sized.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
<strong>Rhythm refers to the feeling of the poem -&nbsp;</strong>or, in less pompous terms, the poem&rsquo;s beat and pace. It&rsquo;s not at all unlike the beat of an actual song; in fact, rhythm is practically found in all media of art, as well as in nearly every action.<br />
<br />
In his paper, &ldquo;<a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.563.6268&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf"" target=""_blank"">Rhythm and Meaning in Poetry</a>,&rdquo; <strong>Patrick Suppes</strong> lists tons of examples of rhythm: the pendulum of a clock, a person&rsquo;s breathing, the running of a dog.<br />
<br />
Suppes asserts that the defining point of rhythm is its regular periodicity. When a poet establishes a strong continuous rhythm, the audience is given a beat to follow along to - and when a poet breaks that rhythm, the audience can be taken out or shaken!</span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:18px"">In English poetry, the rhythmic structure of a poem is called its <strong>meter</strong>. The meter of a poem refers to not just the number of syllables, but also the emphasis of them.<br />
<br />
Poets use patterns of syllables with different stresses to create different meters. One of the most well known meters is <strong>iambic pentameter</strong>, which you may or may not have heard of.<br />
<br />
William Shakespeare, for example, often used iambic pentameter in his sonnets and plays. The first part of the phrase, &ldquo;iambic,&rdquo; refers to iambs, which is the pattern of using unstressed syllables followed by stressed syllables&mdash;-think of the human heartbeat (da-DUM). </span></p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><span style=""color:#e74c3c""><em><span style=""font-size:22px"">The opposite of an iamb is a <strong>trochee</strong> -&nbsp;a stressed syllable followed by an unstressed syllable.</span></em></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">The second part of the phrase refers to the amount of iambs we&rsquo;ll find in one line of poetry; the meter is titled &ldquo;pentameter&rdquo; because in each line, there is five pairs of unstressed-then-stressed syllables (or, ten syllables total!)<br />
<br />
<strong>Iambic pentameter</strong> is not the only type of meter, but understanding it makes understanding other meters fairly easy. For example, if each line has three iambs, it&rsquo;s labelled &ldquo;iambic trimeter.&rdquo; If each line has four trochee, it&rsquo;s labelled &ldquo;trochaic tetrameter.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><span style=""color:#e74c3c""><em><span style=""font-size:22px"">A poem that does not use rhythm (or at least, does not have a set meter) is called <strong>free verse</strong>, which is in and of itself something to take note of!</span></em></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">Meanwhile, <strong>rhyme refers to the sound of the poem</strong>&mdash;-more specifically, using similar sounds in two or more words.<br />
<br />
There can be a lot of variability in exactly what syllables the poet chooses to rhyme, but traditionally in English poetry a rhyme occurs between the last syllables of two lines: &ldquo;I had a small cat/He sat on my hat.&rdquo; The exact pattern of rhymes in a poem is known as its <strong>rhyme scheme</strong>.</span></p>

</script></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">If a poem does not have any consistent rhyme whatsoever, we tend to call it <strong>blank verse</strong>&mdash;-and, again, if you notice that, feel free to point it out!</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">Now you know the basic meanings of these two devices, let&rsquo;s jump into a Wordsworth poem to actually apply our knowledge.<br />
<br />
Below is a stanza of &ldquo;<a href=""https://www.owleyes.org/text/the-lucy-poems/read/Strange-fits-Passion-I-Known#root-219306-1"" target=""_blank"">Strange Fits of Passion I Have Known</a>.&rdquo; In the poem, the speaker is making his way to his lover&rsquo;s house on horseback, quickening his pace all while the moon hangs in the sky.<br />
<br />
The poem goes:</span></p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><span style=""color:#8e44ad""><strong><span style=""font-size:22px""><span style=""font-family:Comic Sans MS,cursive""><em>Upon the moon I fixed my eye,<br />
All over the wide lea;<br />
With quickening pace my horse drew nigh<br />
Those paths so dear to me.</em></span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">As you can see, the poem has both a set rhyme scheme and meter.<br />
<br />
The poem alternates between iambic tetrameter (four pairs of unstressed-stressed syllables) and iambic trimeter (three pairs of unstressed-stressed syllables) with every line.<br />
<br />
f you&rsquo;re having trouble identifying this, try yelling out different parts of the sentence. &ldquo;<strong>UH</strong>-pon <strong>THE</strong> moon <strong>I</strong> fixed <strong>MY</strong> eye&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t roll of the tongue quite as well &ldquo;up-<strong>ON</strong> the <strong>MOON</strong> I <strong>FIXED</strong> my <strong>EYE</strong>.&rdquo; </span></p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><em><span style=""font-size:22px"">Practice makes perfect, so experiment with how the words sound...just, don&rsquo;t do it in a library&hellip;</span></em></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">As for the rhyme, every other line rhymes with one another. &ldquo;Eye&rdquo; rhymes with &ldquo;nigh&rdquo; while &ldquo;lea&rdquo; rhymes with &ldquo;me.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
When we mark out rhyme schemes, we tend to do so with letters, marking the lines that rhyme with the same letters; in this case, the rhyme scheme is ABAB.</span></p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><span style=""font-size:22px""><span style=""color:#e74c3c""><em><strong>But what does this actually mean? Why use rhyme or rhythm here?</strong></em></span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>Rhyme and rhythm are literary devices, like metaphor and simile</strong>. There&rsquo;s not one reason a poet would use rhyme or one meaning that a rhythm could hold, much like there isn&rsquo;t one singular reason/meaning for every metaphor in existence.<br />
<br />
Sometimes it&rsquo;s to sound nice, sometimes it&rsquo;s to create an atmosphere, sometimes it&rsquo;s to aid a certain thematic point. </span></p>

<p style=""text-align:center"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><img alt=""Poetry Literature"" src=""https://tutorcity.sg/admin_tutor/attachments/uploads/Poetry_Literature.png"" style=""border-style:solid; border-width:2px; height:250px; width:380px"" /></p>

<p style=""text-align:center"">&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>Wordsworth</strong> was a romanticist; he explored the importance of nature, humanity, and emotions by depicting detailed and beautiful scenes and atmospheres.<br />
<br />
The continuous, alternating pace of the poem given by the meter combined with the poem&rsquo;s constant rhyming gives the poem an almost song-like quality.<br />
<br />
In addition, the poem&rsquo;s beat is quick, sharp, and present throughout the entire work&mdash;-it mimics the galloping of a horse, which is exactly what the speaker is hearing throughout the poem!<br />
<br />
This may sound like a bit of a stretch, but Wordsworth was known for paying close attention to the rhythm found in everyday life, <a href=""https://scroll.in/article/958977/natures-rhythm-and-rhyme-remembering-william-wordsworth-250-years-since-his-birth"" target=""_blank"">even writing his poems to the pace of his own footsteps</a>!</span></p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><span style=""color:#e74c3c""><span style=""font-size:22px""><em>Rhythm and rhyme can also be <strong>purposefully broken</strong> for certain sections of a poem&nbsp;</em></span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">As an audience, we&rsquo;re very receptive to changes like this&mdash;-think of how we can notice when a singer messes up a line, or when two words don&rsquo;t sound quite right.<br />
<br />
Typically, if rhythm and rhyme are broken, the poet wants us to take notice&mdash;-they&rsquo;re practically holding up a sign saying &ldquo;Hey! Look at this part!&rdquo;<br />
<br />
Wordsworth does this a lot. Most notably, he does this in &ldquo;<a href=""https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45527/lines-composed-a-few-miles-above-tintern-abbey-on-revisiting-the-banks-of-the-wye-during-a-tour-july-13-1798"" target=""_blank"">Lines Composed a Few Miles above Tintern Abbey, On Revisiting the Banks of the Wye during a Tour. July 13, 1798</a>,&rdquo; which, aside from having maybe the longest title in the history of poetry, is typically considered to be one of his best works.<br />
<br />
The first stanza of &ldquo;Tintern Abbey&rdquo; is a beast at twenty-two lines long, all written in iambic pentameter&mdash;-except, that is, for the very last line of the stanza: &ldquo;The Hermit sits alone.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
It&rsquo;s a drastic change in the rhythm of the poem that has been building up, and, as a result, the audience notices this and is drawn to it. The line becomes more poignant.<br />
<br />
Make sure to point out not just when the rhythm and rhyme is set up, but also when it&rsquo;s broken!</span></p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><em><span style=""color:#e74c3c""><span style=""font-size:22px"">Rhythm and rhyme are simple concepts to understand, but they can be super difficult to master</span></span></em></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">Be sure to practice a lot by reading the poem out-loud and hearing others perform it as well!<br />

","co-ed,same gender school,co-ed school","Co-ed_or_same_gender_school.jpg","<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">Choosing a school for your child calls for detailed planning. Apart from checking their accreditation, education quality, monthly costs, and extracurricular classes, you also have to decide on enrolling them in a co-ed or same-gender school.<br />
<br />
It may seem like a tough choice for parents, so in this article, you&rsquo;ll hopefully be able to know which type of school your child will thrive in.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>What&rsquo;s the Difference Between Co-ED and Same-Gender Schools?</strong><br />
<br />
Co-Ed schools have a mix of boys and girls studying in the same classroom together. While same-gender schools only allow enrollment of either all boys or all girls in their institution. It&rsquo;s that simple. But the barrier between sexes makes a huge difference in primary and <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/secondary-school-tuition"" target=""_blank"">secondary school tuition</a>.<br />
<br />
After all, children develop their social skills at an early age. Their environment has a long-lasting impact on how they&#39;ll interact with their peers.<br />
<br />
<strong>Benefits of Co-ED Schools</strong><br />
<br />
<em><strong>1. Promotes Gender Equality</strong></em><br />
<br />
Most institutions and <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/blog/6-reasons-why-tuition-is-necessary-in-singapore"" target=""_blank"">tuition review</a> centers in Singapore use the CO-ED scheme. This creates a balance between girls and boys. It fosters children to respect one another in a classroom setting.<br />
<br />
Boys and girls earn their grades on equal activities and class discussions. It&#39;s important that they feel equal to one another for a progressive future.<br />
<br />
They can carry these values as they grow older. It can even benefit them as they&#39;re employed in an office setting with a diverse workforce.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><em><strong>2. Breaks Communication Barriers</strong></em><br />
<br />
Studying with the opposite sex allows students to communicate with their peers better. This can help reduce anxiety when making friends or dating in the future.<br />
<br />
Boys and girls can learn from one another. Co-ED kids are more empathetic and engaging when it comes to gender discussions, too.<br />
<br />
<em><strong>3. Molds Future-Ready Leaders</strong></em><br />
<br />
Co-EDs allow students to immerse themselves with people from all walks of life.<br />
<br />
Apart from gender equality, empathy, and communication skills, students also develop critical thinking. They will not be oblivious to struggles of the opposite sex as they get older.<br />
<br />
This progressive thinking has helped generations advance their belief systems. It continues to evolve as long as men and women continue mutual respect. Thus, catapulting them to success.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>Benefits of Same-Gender Schools</strong><br />
<br />
<em><strong>1. Has Fewer Distractions</strong></em><br />
<br />
Same-gender schools separate sexes for focus. We don&#39;t mean keeping them apart to avoid romantic relationships. These schools simply strive to bring quality, gender-focused studies for their students.<br />
<br />
Instead of employing focus on each other, same-gender schools spotlight the students themselves. The personal growth of a student is what same-gender schools prioritize.<br />
<br />
<em><strong>2. Creates Better Academic Environment</strong></em><br />
<br />
Specialization classes are what make same-gender schools special.<br />
<br />
Feminism classes can tackle a much wider aspect of an all-girls school. While sports studies can be more concise for all-boys school. There is less friction and students left out from discussions.<br />
<br />
By dividing boys and girls, they can create an optimal classroom environment for what their students need. They&#39;re monitored better to improve their weak points in class.</span></p>

<p><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:18px""><em><strong>3. Adapts Intrapersonal Qualities</strong></em><br />
<br />
Same-gender schools give students an environment to be their most authentic selves. They develop their own emotions and beliefs before socializing with other people.<br />
<br />
They strengthen the mind of students, as well as their self-esteem and confidence. This fosters a strong individual who can take on any challenge in the future.<br />
<br />
Is your child in need to develop their social skills? A co-ed school is an advisable option. Does he/she need to focus on their internal capabilities? a same-gender school can help them get into shape.<br />
<br />
The bottom line is: Co-ED and Same-gender schools have their own merits. It&#39;s up to you to learn which type of school your child will grow.<br />

<br />
Not only is the skill directly quizzed on the exam itself, it&rsquo;s also the focus of the first section of your Internal Assessment where you&rsquo;ll be asked to evaluate two of the most valuable sources you used in your research.<br />
<br />
Plus, if you&rsquo;re planning to do your Extended Essay in anything related to history, you&rsquo;ll be expected to provide proper evaluation of your sources at some point. But what does evaluating your sources actually mean?</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">On some level, we all know how to evaluate our sources a little bit. We know that, for example, a blog post made by a thirteen year old isn&rsquo;t necessarily as credible as a scientific study or report done by professionals. And, we probably also know that some sources are more handy in some situations rather than others depending on the context.<br />
<br />
For example, while that scientific report may be more accurate, if you&rsquo;re specifically trying to find what thirteen year olds think about a certain issue, then it might be helpful to hear it directly from a thirteen year old&rsquo;s blog.<br />
<br />
A source is really all that you make of it. </span></p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><span style=""color:#e74c3c""><strong><em><span style=""font-size:18px"">Every source has its strengths and flaws, and identifying those can help make your argument more effective.</span></em></strong></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">For that, we use the <strong><a href=""https://www.commackschools.org/Downloads/OPCVL Reference Sheet2.pdf"" target=""_blank"">OPCVL Method</a></strong>. That means that, with every source, we ask ourselves a question: With respect to the source&rsquo;s origin, purpose, and content, what are the values and limitations of the source?<br />
<br />
Now, that&rsquo;s a fancy way that we word it to sound professional, but we can break that down into something easier to understand.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>The strengths of a source are its values. </strong>That&rsquo;s easy enough, right?<br />
<br />
It&rsquo;s the good parts of the source&mdash;the parts that you&rsquo;re probably using and calling upon to make that argument.<br />
<br />
On the other end, the limitations of a source are its blind spots and flaws. Sometimes, sources are bad. They might make leaps in logic, only look at a certain perspective, or just shouldn&rsquo;t be trusted. That said, bad sources aren&rsquo;t the only sources with limitations!<br />
<br />
There&rsquo;s no source that can tell us everything, and thus <strong>every source has some limit to what we can derive from it.</strong> That&rsquo;s why the limitations of a source don&rsquo;t just include the source&rsquo;s flaws but also its blind spots&mdash;areas that it couldn&rsquo;t possibly tell us about.<br />
<br />
The actual extent of which you point out either the values or limitations of a source might depend on what argument you&rsquo;re making. </span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">- If you&rsquo;re trying to validate the argument a source makes and justify your reason for using it, you&rsquo;ll probably mostly point out its values. </span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">- If you want to argue against a certain point, it can be particularly powerful to deconstruct and point out the various limitations of a source that the argument relies on. </span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">Presenting only one side of the argument (i.e: all the good parts of your source or all the bad parts of another source) is sometimes called <strong><a href=""https://changingminds.org/techniques/propaganda/card_stacking.htm"" target=""_blank"">card-stacking</a></strong>, and while it can be a helpful device to making your argument appear stronger and we tend to all do it at least a little bit, <u>the IBO wants you to try and stay away from that as much as possible.</u></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><span style=""color:#e74c3c""><em><strong><span style=""font-size:18px"">&quot;So, for the most part, try and get in the habit of identifying at least two values and limitations for every source you come across.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Even if you don&rsquo;t include it all in your actual writing, it&rsquo;ll help you practice for what to come.&quot;</span></strong></em></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">To identify a value or limitation, we need to look at the various things that make a source a source. Every source has an origin&mdash;when it was made, who made it, who was it made for, who published it, where and how it was published, etc.<br />
<br />
This can range from talking about the author, to the context a source was written, to the medium the source is in (we don&rsquo;t use diary entries in the same way that we use official government documents, for example!)<br />
<br />
In addition to that, every source is made with a particular purpose;<br />
+ Was the source made just to educate?<br />
+&nbsp;Was it part of a propaganda movement?<br />
+&nbsp;Do they want you to buy something, or think a particular way of a particular side?<br />
<br />
Finally, each source, of course, has the actual content of the source.<br />
+&nbsp;What does the source actually say, and what does it cover?<br />
+&nbsp;What are the arguments of the source?<br />
<br />
<strong>With these three parts, it becomes easier to segment and acknowledge where the actual values and limitations of a source lie.</strong><br />
<br />
Take the source&rsquo;s origin, for example. You may have heard the terms &ldquo;primary source&rdquo; and &ldquo;secondary source&rdquo; before.<br />
<br />
1) <strong>Primary sources</strong> are sources made and written by those at a particular event; for example, a diary entry from a child in the midst of an economic recession, or a government document that recorded certain actions that the government took at a time.<br />
<br />
2)&nbsp;<strong>Secondary sources</strong> are sources that come after an event, like textbooks and scholarly articles. Neither type of source is objectively better than the other, but each has certain values and limitations that the other does not have.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">A primary source may have the benefit of having actually experienced the event and giving a personal account of it (something that a secondary source inherently lacks), but it might miss out on the multiple perspectives and hindsight that a secondary source can have!<br />
<br />
The specific medium a form is in may play a role in how we view it, too. Political cartoons can tell us the perspective of the public, but aren&rsquo;t the best insight as to how the government thinks of things.<br />
<br />
A source&rsquo;s origin is also prime for evaluation because of how evident our biases can be. Bias has become a sorta loaded term, but in reality it is not enough evaluation to simply say that a source has a bias. <strong><a href=""http://kirwaninstitute.osu.edu/research/understanding-implicit-bias/"" target=""_blank"">We all have implicit biases</a></strong>!<br />
<br />
What matters is what those biases are, so point them out! If a source is saying some really rude things about poor people, and then you look at the author and it was made by a rich person, then you&rsquo;ve found a good talking point for OPCVL!<br />
<br />
Purpose often goes hand in hand with origin, but it&rsquo;s important to distinguish it.<br />
Was the source made to convince the public on a political issue?<br />
Or was it a commercial, made to sell as many products as possible?<br />
<br />
A commercial might be limiting if we wanted to find only the facts of a product, but if we want to find how a company presents itself to the public it might be incredibly valuable!<br />
<br />
Content can either be the easiest part of OPCVL or the hardest. Sometimes, there&rsquo;s really low-hanging fruit: </span></p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><span style=""color:#e74c3c""><strong><em><span style=""font-size:18px"">&ldquo;The content is of value to the historian because it covers the entirety of the war, the content is of limited use to the historian because it does not cover these certain years of the war, etc.&rdquo; </span></em></strong></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">Sometimes, you might have to actively dig through the argument and find the strengths and weaknesses of the logic used and the message made.<br />
<br />
The best advice here is to think of the general stuff, then hone in! What&rsquo;s your reaction to the source? If something sounds weird or illogical, maybe point it out! No historian is infallible, so it might be a great criticism.<br />
<br />
Present your evaluation using something similar to this sentence frame:</span></p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><strong><span style=""color:#e74c3c""><span style=""font-size:18px"">&ldquo;The {origin, purpose, or content } is {of value/of limited value}&nbsp;to the historian because...&rdquo;</span></span></strong></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">&ldquo;The is to the historian because...&rdquo; This shows <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/ib-tuition"" target=""_blank""><strong>IB examiners</strong>&nbsp;</a>that you are clearly identifying and evaluating your sources and can help make sure that you don&rsquo;t miss any points. Really, like with all things in life, the best way to improve your evaluating skills is to practice over and over.<br />
<br />
Get into debates online, and evaluate your sources and your partner&rsquo;s sources! Read articles, and try to find the biases that might be worth criticizing and mentioning.<br />
<br />
Think actively about what you&rsquo;re consuming and why somebody wants you to see it. It&rsquo;ll not only help you on your exam and IA but will also help you be more conscious of the media and arguments you take in!<br />

<span style=""font-size:18px"">The GCE O level examination often causes many Secondary students sleepness nights and anxiety in the last few months leading up to the exam.<br />
<br />
Here are <u><strong>5 revisions tips and strategies</strong></u> from ex-students and teachers to score your As!</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>Tip 1 - Know the topics to be examined</strong></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">The <a href=""https://www.seab.gov.sg/home/examinations/gce-o-level"" target=""_blank"">GCE &lsquo;O&rsquo; Level Chemistry Examination</a> tests students&rsquo; abilities on <strong>applying chemistry</strong> concepts to problems which also require deep knowledge of chemical definitions and formulas.<br />
<br />
In fact, at least <u><strong>70% - 80%</strong></u> of the marks are awarded towards questions on understanding and application of key chemistry concepts. The balance are for writing out facts and definitions.</span></p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><span style=""font-size:22px""><strong><span style=""color:#e74c3c"">This means a memorize and regurgitate strategy at the last minute would not work!</span></strong></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">Topics you need to master:<br />
<br />
+ Know the <strong>definitions</strong> and use of chemical formulae, units and symbols.<br />
<br />
+ Knowledge of <strong>observation</strong> in experiments<br />
<br />
+ Use <strong>chemical calculations</strong> to solve problems in chemical reactions, mole concepts etc<br />
<br />
+ Plot and interpret <strong>diagrams</strong> and graphs<br />
<br />
+ Solve questions relating to <strong>Qualitative Analysis</strong><br />
<br />
+ Write about economic, social, environmental aspects of chemical uses in industrial / medical areas<br />
<br />
Based on the revised <strong><a href=""https://www.seab.gov.sg/home/examinations/gce-o-level"" target=""_blank"">O-level syllabus</a></strong>, secondary school chemistry topics will include social and environmental issues relating to the use of chemicals, energy and chemical industries, the world&rsquo;s finite resources and the <strong>use of chemistry</strong> in daily life.<br />
<br />
By acquiring knowledge in chemistry, your child will be <strong>more informed</strong> about the technological world and improve his social knowledge in the use of chemistry</span></p>

<p><br />
<span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>Tip 2 - Memorise the periodic table</strong><br />
<br />
This is a must!<br />
<br />
All Secondary students must know how to use the <strong><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table"" target=""_blank"">Periodic Table</a></strong>.</span></p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><span style=""font-size:22px""><strong><em><span style=""color:#e74c3c"">The Periodic Table has plenty of information that can help students to solve questions across the entire paper.</span></em></strong></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">Students can glean information such as mass number, period number etc from the periodic table directly, they can also <strong>deduce selective scientific information</strong> from these data points.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>Tip 3 - Plan Your Timings</strong><br />
<br />
Understand what each question needs to be answered and the <strong>marks allocated</strong>, so you can plan your time around it.<br />
<br />
Questions with &ldquo;<strong>Outline</strong>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<strong>Describe</strong>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<strong>Define</strong>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<strong>State</strong>&rdquo; are factual and need basic explanation of concepts, thus marks will tend to be lower. </span></p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><span style=""font-size:22px""><span style=""color:#e74c3c""><strong>If you are stuck and cannot recall, don&rsquo;t waste time and move on! </strong></span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">Higher-end questions that require more detailed answers such as &lsquo;<strong>Based on your observations</strong>&hellip;&rsquo; will have more marks allocated to it, so spend more time on these.</span></p>

<p><br />
<span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>Tip 4 - Understand the Link Between Topics</strong><br />
<br />
For <strong>Chemistry Paper 2</strong>, there are questions that may require answers from <u>2 or more topics</u>, thus students have to be well-versed in most of the topics and their key content.<br />
<br />
<strong>Some of the main topics:</strong><br />
<br />
- Kinetic Particle Theory<br />
- Chemical Equations<br />
- Atomic Structure<br />
- Mole Concept<br />
- Energy Changes<br />
<br />
<strong>Some of the possible combinations:</strong><br />
<br />
Periodic Table + Chemical Bonding or Metals/Salts<br />
Separation Techniques + Elements, Compounds and Mixtures<br />
Oxidation Reactions + Electrolysis<br />
Chemical Bonding + Atomic Structure</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>Tip 5 - Hire an expert Chemistry tutor</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><img alt=""O level Tuition"" src=""https://tutorcity.sg/admin_tutor/attachments/uploads/O_Level_Tuition_Singapore.jpg"" style=""border-style:solid; border-width:1px; height:260px; width:350px"" /><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">If you notice that your child is struggling with topics such as atomic structure or covalent bonding, then it is time to get a reliable tutor to prepare for <strong>O level <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/chemistry-tuition"" target=""_blank"">chem tuition</a></strong> / <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/ip-tuition""><strong>IP chemistry tuition</strong></a> / <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/ib-tuition"" target=""_blank""><strong>IB chemistry tuition</strong></a> and give your child a boost in scoring an A for Chemistry.</span></p>","1","2020-05-29","2020-05-29 21:03:50"

<span style=""font-size:18px"">The <strong><a href=""https://www.seab.gov.sg/home/examinations/gce-a-level"">GCE A level </a></strong>chemistry exam today is much higher compared to secondary level, especially for the H2 chemistry topics which include <em>optical isomers, reaction kinetics, halogen derivatives and many more</em>.<br />
<br />
The A level chemistry syllabus is extensive, plus demanding <strong>practical assessments</strong> in laboratory, tough promotional exams in JC1 which ends with an even tougher A-level examinations, causes JC students to panic as they approach the exams.<br />
<br />
Here are&nbsp;<strong>5 revision tips and strategies</strong> from ex-students and teachers to score your As!</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><u><strong>Tip 1 - Know the exam format well</strong></u><br />
<br />
<strong>Paper 1: Multiple Choice Questions </strong><br />
30 multiple-choice questions of 1 mark each.<br />
Max score is 30 marks which contributes to <u><strong>15%</strong></u> of total score.<br />
<br />
<strong>Paper 2: Structured &amp; Free-Response Questions</strong><br />
Maximum of 75 marks and this constitutes to <u><strong>30%</strong></u> of the total score.<br />
<br />
<strong>Paper 3: Free Response Questions</strong><br />
The weightage of Paper 3 is <u><strong>35%</strong></u>&nbsp;of the total score.<br />
There are 2 sections:<br />
Section A (compulsory) - This comprise of 3 to 4 free-response questions<br />
Section B &ndash; Choose 1 out of 2 questions.<br />
<br />
<strong>Paper 4: Practical Assessment</strong><br />
This contributes to <strong><u>20%</u></strong>&nbsp;of the overall grade. Paper 4 tests the student&rsquo;s skills of observation, analysis, planning, measurement and data presentation.<br />
Duration - 2 hour 30 minutes to complete the assessment</span></p>

<p><br />
<u><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>Tip 2 - Know the main topics that will be tested so you can prepare for it:</strong></span></u><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:14px"">Atomic Structure &amp; Chemical Bonding<br />
The Gaseous State<br />
Theories of Acids and Bases<br />
The Periodic Table<br />
The Mole Concept and Stoichiometry<br />

Transition Elements</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><u><strong>Tip 3 - Make a Summary of key question types and answers</strong></u><br />
<br />
One strategy is to keep a notebook of question types and answer, where you <strong>summarize the key concepts</strong> by each topic so you can recall the answers quicker.</span></p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><span style=""font-size:22px""><strong><em><span style=""color:#e74c3c"">This ensures that when you see a similar question, you can immediately identify the topic being examined and the correct steps to reach the answer.</span></em></strong></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">Even when you see a harder question, you can easily break down what they testing for.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:18px""><u><strong>Tip 4 - Practice A Lot!</strong></u><br />
<br />
<strong>Revise thoroughly</strong> your lecture questions, tutorials, revision packages and other school exam papers so you can be exposed to a variety of questions.<br />
<br />
Memorise and note down how to answer these questions into a compilation e.g. notebook.</span></p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><span style=""color:#e74c3c""><span style=""font-size:22px""><strong>If you make any conceptual mistake, write it down too so you remember to <u>not</u> make the same mistake again.</strong></span></span></p>

<p><br />
<span style=""font-size:18px""><u><strong>Tip 5 - Get a JC Chemistry Tutor</strong></u><br />

<br />
Facing the exams in 3 months with such a grade leads to panic and anxiety among many JC students. A-level Economics is a relatively difficult subject to score and we understand the stress you are facing.<br />
<br />
Here are some strategies which we hope is of some help:</span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><u><strong>1. Know the topics and what is going to be tested&nbsp;</strong></u><br />
<br />
Check the syllabuses in <strong><a href=""https://www.seab.gov.sg/home/examinations/gce-a-level"" target=""_blank"">SEAB A-level page</a></strong> for [<strong><a href=""https://www.seab.gov.sg/home/examinations/gce-a-level/a-level-syllabuses-examined-for-school-candidates-2020"" target=""_blank"">2020</a></strong>] and [<strong><a href=""https://www.seab.gov.sg/home/examinations/gce-a-level/a-level-syllabuses-examined-for-school-candidates-2021"">2021</a></strong>]</span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:18px"">To prep well, you need to have a strong grasp of the common topics in <strong>H2 Econs syllabus</strong> such as:<br />
<br />
+ Types of markets Resource allocation<br />
+ Opportunity cost<br />
+ Market failure<br />
+ Government intervention in various countries<br />
+ Economic indicators for measurements<br />
+ Fiscal and Monetary policies<br />
+ Accounting practices</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong><u>2. Plan Your Time</u></strong><br />
<br />
Next thing you need to learn is how much time to <strong>allocate</strong> to each question. You need to learn the <strong>marking scheme </strong>and answer according to what markers want.<br />
<br />
In Paper 1, all the topics are covered so you have to spread your time almost universally. </span></p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><span style=""color:#e74c3c""><span style=""font-size:18px"">If you get stuck, move on and <strong>don&rsquo;t waste time</strong>.</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">For Paper 2, you need to choose 3 out of 6 questions, at least 1 micro and 1 macro question to be attempted. Each question requires you to be well-versed with 1 topic.<br />
<br />
A <strong>market failure question</strong> would almost be a certainty every year so plan your studying around this to be able to craft a really solid answer.<br />
<br />
The other 2 questions are probably easier as they are mostly macro problems and policies-related. </span></p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><span style=""color:#e74c3c""><span style=""font-size:18px"">You should invest some time into these 2 questions as <strong>they can let you score an A</strong>.</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong><u>3. Learn how to answer Case study Questions</u></strong><br />
<br />
There are a few set of skills that you need to learn to <strong>answer case study</strong> questions efficiently.<br />
<br />
Some types of questions found are definition and trend questions which are <u>1-4 marks</u>, application of theory questions which are about <u>4-8 marks</u> and higher order questions worth <u>6-10 marks</u>.<br />
<br />
To answer case study questions, you will need to <strong><u>take these steps</u></strong>:<br />
<br />
1. Identify the <strong>theory</strong> or concept that the question wants to test<br />
2. Find the statistics or <strong>data</strong> that support or refute the theory<br />
3. Apply limitations or <strong>supporting</strong> argument<br />
4. <strong>Evaluate</strong> e.g. pros and cons<br />
<br />
Continuous practice with other school exam papers and assessment books will give you a better idea on the trends of answering these questions.</span></p>

You will need to read widely because you have to <strong>substantiate</strong> your arguments with examples and case studies.<br />

We analyse here from the view of one IB student","TOK,theory of knowledge,area of knowledge,arts,IB tok","TOK_The_Arts_as_an_AOK.jpg","<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>Theory of Knowledge</strong> is one of the most broad IB courses out there, and for good reason! You can&rsquo;t exactly cover the philosophy of knowing everything without being a bit broad in your scope!<br />
<br />
Really, you could spend an entire year covering even just one <strong>area of knowledge</strong>. But, you don&rsquo;t have that kind of time, so let&rsquo;s just use this article to do a deep dive into one area of knowledge: <strong>the arts</strong>!<br />
<br />
The Arts make up one of my personal favorite AoKs. Whether you&rsquo;re talking about the creation of The Arts or the consumption of it, there&rsquo;s plenty to talk about and connect to the various WoKs.</span></p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><span style=""color:#e74c3c""><em><strong><span style=""font-size:18px"">We&rsquo;ve all consumed some form of art...</span></strong></em></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">- whether it be the books we read or the TV shows we watch - and it&rsquo;s very likely that many of us have made art at some point, too.<br />
<br />
For every single medium and genre of art, there&rsquo;s tons of examples, theories, debates, and situations to pull from, and, because of <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/blog/how-technological-innovations-are-transforming-ib-education"" target=""_blank"">technology, finding information and sources</a> about all of this is easier than ever before. This also makes it a great subject to pull on when writing your ToK essay.<br />
<br />
In this article, we&rsquo;ll go through all of the different <strong>WoKs</strong>, and see how we can apply them to how we know what we know about The Arts. Again, there&rsquo;s more to The Arts than this one article can cover, so don&rsquo;t limit yourself to just our ideas; use this article as a jumping off.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>Way of Knowing One</strong>: Sense perception.<br />
<br />
This is probably the easiest and most obvious WoK to apply to The Arts. For the most part, art is, ultimately, something that works on our senses. In visual mediums like painting and cinematography, the art is made for us to see; in auditory mediums like music, the art is made primarily for us to hear.<br />
<br />
Some pieces of art combine all of the senses, while some are made to purposefully defy certain senses. Some great knowledge questions to ask yourself here are: </span></p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><em><span style=""font-size:18px"">&ldquo;How do the arts take advantage of our sense perception to get their point across?&rdquo; and </span></em></p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><em><span style=""font-size:18px"">&ldquo;How can those with different/disabled sense perception make and enjoy art?&rdquo;</span></em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>Way of Knowing Two</strong>: Language.<br />
<br />
What language do we use to refer to, analyse, or critique art, and what significance does that language hold?<br />
<br />
Those <strong>IB Art </strong>students out there probably know that each medium of art has its own unique lingo! In professional visual arts discussions, you&rsquo;ll often hear about the <a href=""https://www.hebisd.edu/cms/lib/TX50000437/Centricity/Domain/76/documents/Elementary Art Curriculum Framework/Elements_and_Principles_of_Art_A.pdf"" target=""_blank"">elements and principles of art</a>, animators in the audience may know something about the <a href=""https://www.creativebloq.com/advice/understand-the-12-principles-of-animation"" target=""_blank"">principles of animation</a>, and <a href=""https://verifiedkeys.com/a-guide-on-the-basic-principles-of-music-theory/"" target=""_blank"">musicians out there know the basic principles of music</a>.<br />
<br />
We create specific language to refer to these things and better our understanding. But how important is it that somebody actually knows these terms? Can you be a great artist and not have this linguistic understanding?</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>Way of Knowing Three</strong>: Emotion.<br />
<br />
This should also be pretty simple! Art makes us feel things. Art is deeply related to both the emotions of the artist and the emotions of the audience.<br />
<br />
How does one&rsquo;s emotional state play into how they look at and analyse a piece of art? Why do we feel so connected to certain pieces of art in the first place? How valuable is that?</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>Way of Knowing Four</strong>: Reason.<br />
<br />
This might be a controversial one! Some may argue that there&rsquo;s no reason to art at all, and that we cannot apply an objective set of logic or reasoning to all forms of art.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, some may say that making a good art piece is as easy as following a few simple formulas. Is there such a thing as <strong>objectivity in art</strong>? Can we scientifically <strong>evaluate art</strong>? Is there even a way to necessarily optimally teach art?</span></p>

     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>Way of Knowing Five</strong>: Imagination.<br />
<br />
You can&rsquo;t make art without imagination, can you? No, seriously, I&rsquo;m actually asking. <a href=""https://www.interaliamag.org/articles/imagination-and-art/"" target=""_blank"">Is imagination absolutely required to make a good art piece?</a><br />
<br />
What truly is original and unoriginal in the art world?<br />
<br />
Can technical skill make up entirely for a lack of imagination?<br />
<br />
Also, if we need imagination to make art, do we need imagination to analyse and critique it as well?<br />
<br />
Can art inspire imagination, or is it something you&rsquo;re born with. </span></p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><span style=""color:#e74c3c""><em><strong><span style=""font-size:18px"">There&rsquo;s especially a lot to talk about here, so go wild!</span></strong></em></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:center"">&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>Way of Knowing Six</strong>: Faith.<br />
<br />
What place does spirituality play in The Arts?<br />
<br />
How can we use art to convey our belief in something?<br />
<br />
When making art, don&rsquo;t we have some sort of faith in the artistic process to actually finish our product?<br />
<br />
This is definitely the trickiest WoK to apply to The Arts, <strong>but it can be done</strong>?</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>Way of Knowing Seven</strong>: Intuition.<br />
<br />
This one connects to another WoK: reason.<br />
<br />
Sure, we can come up with art and color theories to help us point out what we like and dislike about a piece of art, but how much of art is actually based on logical responses like that, and how much of it is based on pure intuition.<br />
<br />
Have you ever seen a piece of art and just instinctively thought that it was ugly or beautiful?<br />
<br />
Where does that impulse come from, and how valid is it when we make and analyse art?</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>Way of Knowing Eight</strong>: Memory.<br />
<br />
What makes art memorable?<br />
<br />
Is it purely its skill, or something else?<br />
<br />
Bad movies can be memorable, too---is that a different type of memory than the memories we have of really good pieces of art?<br />
<br />
Does art have to be timeless to stay in our memories, or should it seek to evoke the emotion of when it was written?<br />
<br />
If a piece of art is good, but unremarkable, how good of a piece is it, really?</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>And that&rsquo;s our rundown!</strong> As you can see, there&rsquo;s tons of great knowledge questions and tangents you can ask yourself about The Arts, so lean into it!

<span style=""font-size:18px"">To get an A1 for the <strong>O&nbsp;level Biology examination</strong> is an aim that many Secondary 4 students have, so we have curated some strategies from other graduating students to share with you.<br />
<br />
Be it pure or combined sciences, the steps you have to take are similar, there is no easy way out!<br />
<br />
Here are some revisions tips and strategies&nbsp;from biology graduates who know their stuff well:</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>Tip 1 - Understand the Exam Format&nbsp;</strong></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">The <a href=""https://www.seab.gov.sg/home/examinations/gce-o-level"" target=""_blank"">GCE &lsquo;O&rsquo; Level Biology Examination</a> tests students&rsquo; abilities on <strong>applying biology</strong> concepts to problems which also require deep knowledge of biological definitions. The format differs for pure and combined Biology<br />
<br />
For <u><strong>pure</strong></u> biology, there are 3 papers:<br />
<br />
Paper 1 - MCQ, <strong>30% </strong>of total score<br />
This consist of 40 compulsory multiple choice questions.<br />
<br />
Paper 2 - Free Response Questions, <strong>50% </strong>of total score<br />
Section A with 50 marks, Section B with 30 marks<br />
There are 2 compulsory questions and 1 data-based question.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Paper 3 - SPA (Practical), <strong>20%</strong> of total score<br />
This is done during school time and students are tested on their observation, analysing and planning skills.</span><br />
<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">For <u><strong>combined</strong></u> biology, there are a different combination of&nbsp;papers. For example, a student taking combined Physics with Biology will be taking Paper 1, 2, 4 and 5.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">Paper 1 - MCQ, <strong>20%</strong> of total score<br />
This consist of 40 compulsory multiple choice questions.<br />
<br />
Paper 2 (<strong>Physics</strong>)- Free Response Questions, <strong>32.5%</strong> of total score<br />
or<br />
Paper 3&nbsp;(<strong>Chemistry</strong>)- Free Response Questions, <strong>32.5%</strong> of total score</span><br />
<span style=""font-size:18px"">or</span><br />
<span style=""font-size:18px"">Paper 4&nbsp;(<strong>Biology</strong>)- Free Response Questions, <strong>32.5%</strong> of total score<br />
2 sections, Section A consist of compulsory questions and Section B you have to choose 2 out of 3 questions.</span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:18px"">Paper 5&nbsp;- SPA (Practical), <strong>15% </strong>of total score<br />
This consist of 1 or 2 compulsory questions on each of the 2 sciences.</span></p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/biology-tuition"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""Biology Tuition for Sec JC IB IGCSE"" src=""https://tutorcity.sg/admin_tutor/attachments/uploads/Biology_Tuition_Singapore_tutor.jpg"" style=""border-style:solid; border-width:1px; height:260px; width:350px"" /></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>Tip 2 - Master Key Topics</strong></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">For pure and combined biology, there are some topics that you need to have a good grasp of so as to answer all types of questions.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">+ Principles of Biology, key areas are&nbsp;Cell Structure and Organisation, Movement of Substances, Biological Molecules.<br />
+&nbsp;Maintenance and Regulation of Life Processes: Nutrition in Humans/Plants, Homeostasis,&nbsp;Respiration &amp; Excretion in Humans, Transport in Plants and Humans<br />
+&nbsp;Reproduction, Cell Division, Molecular Genetics&nbsp;<br />
+&nbsp;Man and his Environment</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">For full list of the topics being tested, you can check SEAB&#39;s website on their <strong><a href=""https://www.seab.gov.sg/home/examinations/gce-o-level"" target=""_blank"">O-level syllabus</a>.</strong></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>Tip 3&nbsp;- Know the Periodic Table well. </strong></span></p>

<p><br />
<span style=""font-size:18px"">All Secondary students must know how to use the <strong><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table"" target=""_blank"">Periodic Table</a></strong>.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">Students can save time checking up the periodic table if you know where to find the information and can also <strong>deduce selective scientific information</strong> from these data points.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>Tip 4 - Plan Your Timings</strong><br />
<br />
Understand what each question needs to be answered and the <strong>marks allocated</strong>, so you can plan your time around it.</span></p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><em><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""color:#e74c3c""><strong>If you are stuck and cannot recall, don&rsquo;t waste time and move on! </strong></span></span></em></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">Higher-end questions that require more detailed answers such as &lsquo;<strong>Based on your observations</strong>&hellip;&rsquo; will have more marks allocated to it, so spend more time on these.</span></p>

<p><br />
<span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>Tip 5 - Create Your Own Notes</strong><br />
<br />
There are many students who swear by this. Creating your own notes always works, even just copying word for word from your textbook would you give you a good overview of the topics.<br />
<br />
Build up your content knowledge by creating your own notes, even if they will end up with hundreds of pages as Bio notes are all very long.</span></p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><em><strong><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""color:#e74c3c"">Write notes from your own understanding so its easier for you to memorise.&nbsp;</span></span></strong></em></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">For those things that you don&#39;t understand, ask your biology teachers or classmates to explain.<br />
<br />
You can also create a definition list to compile all those&nbsp;you need to know, so you won&#39;t lose marks on questions that are asking about definitions.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>Tip 6&nbsp;- Practice for MCQ</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:18px"">The MCQ section is purely practice, practice and more practice. Drill yourself with all the assessment books and past years papers that you can find. Its all pure content and <strong>aim for 35 marks</strong> at least.</span><br />
<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>Tip 7&nbsp;- Practical SPA</strong></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">The important thing to do is to always read off your data to try to make as many correct <strong>observations</strong> as possible.<br />
<br />
Even if you get the wrong results, keep calm. Write your data and think of a reason from the observations. Try not to redo the whole test as you may get penalised if you didn&#39;t change your answers based on the new data.</span><br />
<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>Tip 8 - Hire an expert Biology tutor</strong></span><br />

Physics can be hard for some people and we understand that which is why this article is targeted at students that are struggling in the subject of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"" target=""_blank""><strong>Physics</strong></a>.<br />
<br />
Here are 7 strategies which top physics tutors have adopted when they were studying for O levels:</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>1. Know the Exam Format:</strong></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">The <strong><a href=""https://www.seab.gov.sg/home/examinations/gce-o-level"" target=""_blank"">GCE &lsquo;O&rsquo; Level Physics Examination</a></strong> tests students&rsquo; abilities on <strong>applying physics</strong> concepts to problems which also require deep knowledge of physics concepts and theorems.

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">For <u><strong>combined</strong></u> physics, there are a different combination of&nbsp;papers. For example, a student taking combined Physics with Chemistry will be taking Paper 1, 3, 4 and 5.</span></p>

<span style=""font-size:18px"">Paper 5&nbsp;- SPA (Practical), <strong>15% </strong>of total score<br />
This consist of 1 or 2 compulsory questions on each of the 2 sciences.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>2. Master Key Topics:</strong></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">+&nbsp;Units and Measurements used in&nbsp;Physical Quantities<br />
+ Kinematics, Dynamics, Mass, Weight and Density, Turning Effect of Forces,<br />
+&nbsp;Pressure, Energy, Work and Power<br />
+&nbsp;Kinetic Model of Matter, Transfer of Thermal Energy,<br />
+&nbsp;Temperature, Thermal Properties of Matter<br />
+&nbsp;General Wave Properties, Light<br />
+&nbsp;Electromagnetic Spectrum, Sound<br />
+&nbsp;Static Electricity, Current of Electricity, D.C. Circuits, Practical Electricity<br />
+&nbsp;Magnetism, Electromagnetism, Electromagnetic Induction</span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:18px"">For full list of the topics being tested, you can check SEAB&#39;s website on their <strong><a href=""https://www.seab.gov.sg/home/examinations/gce-o-level"" target=""_blank"">GCE &lsquo;O&rsquo; Level </a></strong>syllabus.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>3. Drill and Drill with&nbsp;exampapers</strong><br />
<br />
Past papers are another way that can help you improve your grades. When you study using past papers, you get to look and gain more exposure to what you will expect in the test.<br />
<br />
Knowing what are the expected questions&nbsp;is crucial to planning your time properly during the test. For example, if you practice using <a href=""https://testpapers.com.sg/"" target=""_blank""><strong>past papers</strong></a>, you would be more familiar with what kind of questions would come out.</span></p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><span style=""font-size:18px""><em><span style=""color:#e74c3c""><strong>The same questions would not come out but the way they were phrased might be similar.</strong></span></em> </span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">You would be better prepared if those questions came out as the answers would be similar. Every year, the syllabus will roughly stay the same so even though there may be some questions that would not be tested, a big portion of them will still be tested.<br />
<br />
Use this to your <strong>advantage</strong>. If you started practicing these papers, for example, a year before the exam, your teacher might not have gone through some of the topics but this does not mean you cannot do the practice paper. Do the questions that have already been taught and you can finish the rest when you know how to do them.<br />
<br />
Past papers give you an <strong>amazing insight </strong>into the test and allow you to see how you would do if you were the one taking the test that year. This gives you a good gauge of where you are and helps you in setting achievable targets for the next test that you do. </span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>4. Getting organized </strong><br />
<br />
This is one of the best ways that can help you be more focused and ultimately, do better in your exams. Being organized has many advantages and being unorganized has some grave disadvantages too. <strong>Disorganization</strong> eats away all the precious limited time that you have and all the mental resources too.<br />
<br />
Disorganization might be the reason why you sometimes <strong>can&rsquo;t find your homework</strong>, or your notes easily. When you waste your time trying to locate and track down where everything is, you waste your energy too.</span></p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><em><span style=""color:#e74c3c""><strong><span style=""font-size:18px"">Taking steps to organize your notes, homework and your life is worth your time.</span></strong></span></em></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">Think about it, would you rather spend 30 combined minutes trying to find your materials or spend 5 minutes to plan your day. Disorganization does not only mean not being able to find your belongings but can also mean not being able to <strong>focus</strong> and have a plan.<br />
<br />
When your timings are disorganized, you might spend more time on a certain topic and realize that you wouldn&rsquo;t have enough time allocated to do something else.<br />
<br />
Investing in a diary or a <a href=""https://www.developgoodhabits.com/study-schedule/"" target=""_blank""><strong>study calendar</strong></a> is the way to go. Even if you don&rsquo;t want to buy any of these, the calendar on your phone will suffice.<br />
<br />
When planning your day, take into consideration what <strong>tasks are more important than others</strong> and what events will come up.<br />
<br />
Jotting down events is key because you wouldn&rsquo;t want to end up planning what to do for the day only finding out that your aunt is visiting you from China and you are forced to talk with her.</span></p>

<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>5. Time management </strong><br />
<br />
Time management is very important when studying and revising your work but this point is not about that. This point is about <strong>time management in the test</strong>.<br />
<br />
A common pitfall that many students will fall in is time. </span></p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><span style=""color:#e74c3c""><em><strong><span style=""font-size:18px"">Not having enough time in a test or not being able to finish the questions fast enough is that pitfall.</span></strong></em></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">There are a few reasons why you might not be able to finish the paper on time. One of them is <strong>careless mistakes.</strong> To be able to finish the paper in time, you might look at the clock or your watch and immediately feel anxious.<br />
<br />
This is normal because you are afraid that you would not meet the deadline. In your desperate attempt to finish at least answer all the questions because you should never leave any blank, you rush through the paper. <strong>This is wrong.</strong><br />
<br />
The careless mistake is not reading the question properly. You must pay attention to the details and never try to rush through the paper.<br />
<br />
Allocate your time properly so that each question will be done in a <strong>certain time frame</strong> and not a minute more.</span></p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><span style=""color:#e74c3c""><em><strong><span style=""font-size:18px"">This will at least guarantee that you will finish the paper. </span></strong></em></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">Once you have finished the entire paper, go through your answers again and check those that you have some concerns about.<br />
<br />
Highlight all the <strong>keywords</strong> and look through those keywords the second time when checking. It is known that if you don&rsquo;t get the first part of the question correct, it is very likely that you might get the rest of the question wrong too. <u>If you are facing time constraints, only check the first 2 lines of your answer.</u><br />
<br />
Another reason why you might not be able to complete the paper is <strong>hard questions</strong>. Many students will stop at a hard question and waste so much of their precious time on it.<br />
<br />
You should <strong>spend more time</strong> on the hard questions because it is more likely that you will get something wrong on them but save that for the end. If you stop at a question where you are experiencing difficulty, you might leave other easier questions further on down in the exam unanswered or done poorly.<br />
<br />
This is also a reason why I mentioned to allocate time for each question and know when to skip it and not spend too much unnecessary time. </span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>6. Memorization tips </strong><br />
<br />
Learning Physics is hard for some people mainly because of <strong>memorization</strong>.<br />
<br />
There would be many&nbsp;<strong><a href=""https://www.miniphysics.com/o-level-physics-cheatsheet.html"" target=""_blank"">physics formulaes and procedures</a></strong> and this can stress many students out. This is why knowing a few ways to memorize something effectively will benefit you greatly.</span></p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><img alt=""Memorizing Physics"" src=""https://tutorcity.sg/admin_tutor/attachments/uploads/Memorizing_Physics.jpg"" style=""height:300px; width:400px"" /></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">The first would be to..</span></p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><em><span style=""color:#e74c3c""><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>Write these concepts, formulae, and procedures down in a small notebook</strong>. </span></span></em></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">This notebook should be small enough that it wouldn&rsquo;t be a big convenience if you are carrying it around wherever you go.<br />
<br />
Whenever you are free, whether it be waiting for a bus or queueing up to buy food, <strong>take out the notebook</strong> from your pocket or bag, and start looking through.<br />
<br />
Repeat what you wrote out <strong>loud</strong> and make sure that your ears can hear what your mouth is saying. <u>It has been proven that people that people some people who here things will be more likely to remember them.</u><br />
<br />
This also explains why you will remember a song if you listen to it many times.<br />
<br />
The second way would be to create <a href=""https://www.lucidchart.com/"" target=""_blank""><strong>mindmaps</strong></a> or diagrams that help you to remember it more vividly. Mindmaps help to summarize a topic and creating the mindmap is a form of revision too. To create the mindmap, you have to go through the topic and your notes.<br />
<br />
Mindmaps help you to see the topic from a <strong>different standpoint</strong>, you will be able to see it from a birds-eye view. These mindmaps will be helpful in the very last few days leading up to the exam. You wouldn&rsquo;t have enough time to revise an entire topic again so it&rsquo;s best to see all the topics in this way.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>7. Dismantling its parts </strong><br />
<br />
Many questions will look intimidating at first.<br />
<br />
This especially applies to questions that you find hard. <em>Sometimes, it&rsquo;s just the way the question is structured that makes it intimidating.</em><br />
<br />
For example, the question might ask you to explain what a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field"" target=""_blank""><strong>magnetic field</strong></a> is but after taking a good look at it, you will realize that the answers are generally straightforward. The takeaway for this is to never get afraid of the questions.<br />
<br />
In one way or another, if you had studied properly and followed the tips mentioned above, you wouldn&rsquo;t have a problem at all. You will encounter questions that are complicating and are complicating.<br />
<br />
No, I did not make an error there, some questions that are complicating are plain complicating.<br />
<br />
<strong>* These questions exist because they want to differentiate the students that deserve a B and the students that deserve an A</strong><br />
<br />
Dismantle the parts of these questions and <strong>tackle each part first</strong>. Marks are rewarded for each part you answer correctly so roughly finding out which parts are worth more marks helps you to know which parts require more information.<br />
<br />
A question worth 3 marks would require all 3 points to be answered compared to a 1 mark question which would demand less.<br />
<br />
Similarly, knowing which questions require less information will signal to you that you should not provide extra. Providing unnecessary information might also cause you to lose a mark.</span></p>

<br />
<span style=""font-size:18px"">Many students have done the same - memorised all the concepts, reading notes several times and zapped answer sheets from many past exam papers, yet still getting an F or U grade.<br />
<br />
Why is General Paper a different ball game from the Secondary level English, one might ask. As per <strong><a href=""https://www.seab.gov.sg/"" target=""_blank"">SEAB</a></strong>, GP&rsquo;s curriculum is a step up from O level English standard.</span></p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><span style=""color:#e74c3c""><strong><span style=""font-size:18px""><em>Students cannot get away with writing simple short stories about their personal experiences</em>.</span></strong></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">A-level essays require <strong>critical thinking skills</strong> and <strong>content knowledge</strong> on current affairs, global trends etc; Something alien to most students in Singapore.<br />
<br />
We have summarised <strong>6 key strategies on how to score A for GP</strong> from our top GP teachers around Singapore:</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">1.&nbsp;<strong>Know the exam format</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:18px"">To score well in General Paper, you need to know what will be coming out and which areas to focus on.<br />
<br />
[ Paper 1 ] -&nbsp; Essay Writing&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Students have to choose 1 out of 12 questions to answer.&nbsp;<br />
You have to write on issues from various topics such as education, economy, environmentalism, cultural issues etc.<br />
Duration is <strong>1 hour and 30 minutes</strong>. This constitute 50% of the total grade.<br />
<br />
[ Paper 2 ]- Comprehension and Answering Skills<br />
<br />
There will be passages where students will be tested on the comparative analysis skills, demonstrate your ability to comprehend the contents, infer from the passage on the writer&#39;s opinion and then summarize in your own words to evaluate the whole paragraph.<br />
Duration is <strong>1 hour and 30 minutes</strong>. This constitute 50% of the total grade.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">2. <strong>Comprehension &amp; Summary</strong><br />
<br />
Score for these 2 as it&#39;s <u>25%</u> of your grade!<br />
<br />
You need to have a good arsenal of vocabulary and paraphrasing skills, which are very challenging to most students.<br />
<br />
<span style=""color:#8e44ad"">Here&#39;s&nbsp;how you can score for Comprehension &amp; Summary:</span><br />
<br />
a. Learn the <strong>marking scheme</strong> and answer according to what markers want. Its not that difficult!<br />
<br />
b. Read widely during your free time &ndash; news sites, social media sites, ebooks, online discussion forums, anything that can expand your world view and improve vocabulary</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">3. <strong>Argue Argue argue!</strong><br />
<br />
You must learn how to reason, <strong>persuade</strong> and argue constructively.<br />
<br />
Not just memorise and list out everything on what you recall. Every question is different, so you need to customise your arguments to fit into the essay.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">4. <strong>Content Knowledge</strong><br />
<br />
Content knowledge for GP essay&nbsp;is something that most Junior college students will struggle in as these topics are not something that is exposed to them in secondary schools.<br />
<br />
Substantiate your arguments with examples and <strong>case studies</strong>. This comes from hard work and there are no shortcuts! Sorry!<br />
<br />
JC students will also need to read and memorise many facets of the modern world &ndash; current affairs, global economics, local sensitivities, <strong>GP essays on education</strong>, and many topics which seem dull at first sight.</span></p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><em><span style=""color:#e74c3c""><strong><span style=""font-size:18px"">One way is to choose a few topics or styles that you can master...</span></strong></span></em></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">...since its almost impossible to fully remember the great number of topics available. For example, if you like science then read up on topics relating to chemistry or environmentalism, so you can write on something that you are interested in and have a good chance of doing better in it.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">It&rsquo;s important to think of self-guided learning as something supplemental to the learning they are already engaged in; it does not replace classwork or tutoring sessions, but builds on, and ultimately leads to more academic success.<br />
<br />
Parents have long tried to foster a love of learning in their children by taking them to museums, urging nightly reading time, and modeling learning habits themselves. Today, with Circuit Breaker Periods forcing educators and learners to adapt or be left behind, <strong><a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/blog/how-to-use-zoom-for-online-tuition-during-circuit-breaker-period"" target=""_blank"">Tutor City is innovating and delivering the same quality tuition</a></strong> programming via zoom, and believes that embracing online learning is a must.<br />
<br />
Encouraging students to become <strong>self-guided learners</strong> is essential for parents everywhere moving forward, and luckily there are many online resources that can aid them in doing so.<br />
<br />
Self-guided learning is more accessible, enticing, and exciting than ever before with the help of online resources known as <a href=""https://elearningindustry.com/best-elearning-resources-trends-for-keen-learners-2020"" target=""_blank""><strong>eLearning platforms</strong></a>. These can be websites, streaming channels, apps, and more - all with their unique strengths and potential benefits.<br />

Here are the best 3 eLearning Resources for Self-Guided learning that you can get your student utilizing today!</span></p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>&hellip;</strong></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>[ Khan Academy ]</strong></span></p>

<p><a href=""https://www.khanacademy.org/"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""Khan Academy"" src=""https://tutorcity.sg/admin_tutor/attachments/uploads/Khan_Academy.jpg"" style=""border-style:solid; border-width:1px; height:278px; width:650px"" /></a></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong><a href=""https://www.khanacademy.org/"" target=""_blank"">Khan Academy</a></strong> is a website that is used in many schools to supplement classroom instruction. Teachers will often utilize Khan Academy to assign additional fluency practice for basic skills in Math or Science courses, but the platform features content for Humanities, Engineering, and Test Prep as well.<br />
<br />
What&rsquo;s great about Khan Academy is that students <strong>do not need to be part of a classroom</strong> to engage in learning and can make accounts for their own utilization, either with or without parent oversight.<br />
<br />
During Circuit Breaker Periods, where students are away from the systems and routines of their everyday classrooms, sites like Khan Academy can <strong>simulate the structure of schooling</strong> - an added bonus.<br />
<br />
<u>Here&rsquo;s how it works:</u><br />
<br />
When you or your student create an account, you simply select the desired grade and identify up to <strong>5 &lsquo;courses&rsquo;</strong> that you would be interested in. Each course features hours of content - assignments, instructional videos, guided questions and opportunities to reflect and revise work after completion to ensure comprehension.<br />
<br />
If you don&rsquo;t want to complete an entire course and just need help with a specific topic, you can complete a set of assignments for that specific topic, which is a really great feature (say, for example, you want to review ratios without completing an entire Algebra course).<br />
<br />
Khan Academy <strong>grades work completed by students automatically</strong>, so students can both receive immediate feedback and keep track of their own progress.<br />
<br />
It&rsquo;s incredibly easy to navigate, and the usability of the platform is a big part of its massive adoption among educators and families. <strong>Khan Academy is a go-to resource for students looking to become self-guided learners!</strong></span></p>

<br />
The simplest and most effective way for students to make growth in their reading is by&hellip;.reading. And although it sounds really straightforward, children around the globe are reading less than ever before, and many no longer find it can compete with the magic and excitement of screentime.<br />
<br />
Scholastic&rsquo;s Learn at Home program seeks to develop readers by addressing the three biggest barriers to making reading a habit: <strong>consistent routines, interesting material, and sustained interest</strong>. The Learn at Home program offers <strong>4 week outlines</strong> of reading material, free access to the articles it posts in each daily set, and probing questions that students can think about or answer on their own.<br />
<br />
With an easy to navigate format and clear directions, all students or parents must do is select the appropriate grade level, go to the day they are on in the program, and read the suggested articles.<br />
<br />
<strong>That&rsquo;s it! </strong><br />
<br />
What we love about this program is that it makes reading fun. Interesting content is key to compelling kids to read, and this program offers a ton of variety in subjects, styles, and lengths.<br />
<br />
After four weeks of following this program, students will have learned a ton of interesting and trending information, and importantly will have begun the practice of making<strong> self-guided reading</strong> a part of their daily habits.</span></p>

<br />
With <strong>colorful, exciting animation, informative hosts</strong>, and thought provoking insights, Crash Course is an excellent content-producer that has a particular strength for breaking down big ideas in fun, easy to understand videos.<br />
<br />
<em>World History, Microeconomics, Artificial Intelligence</em> - whatever it is that your student is interested in learning about, there&rsquo;s a good chance Crash Course covers it. There are standalone videos, but most content is part of a larger series covering a bigger subject (for example, &lsquo;World History&rsquo; on Crash Course has 42 videos, all around 10-minutes long, all very informative and entertaining).</span></p>

<br />
Are you a student that is worried about your marks because your O-levels are right around the corner?<br />
<br />
Are you an anxious parent because you don&rsquo;t know how to help your child?<br />
<br />
If you answer yes to any of these questions then this article is worth a read. In this article, I will share with you a few tips and strategies that can help you or any other student do better in <strong>O-level Mathematics</strong>.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">1. <strong>Knowing the exam format and requirements</strong><br />
<br />
Knowing the requirements is very vital in scoring well for <strong>Maths</strong>. This includes knowing the structure of the paper and how many marks are in each section.<br />
<br />
Knowing how many marks in each section is also good with time management in the exam. This helps you <strong>allocate time more effectively</strong> for each section so that you don&rsquo;t end up spending too much time on one and end up not ï¬nishing another.</span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:18px"">For O-level Math, these are the 2 papers: â¨<br />
<br />
[ <strong>Paper 1</strong> ] - Short answer questions (SAQ), 50% of the total score<br />
This consists of 25 <strong>compulsory</strong> short answer questions.<br />
<br />
[ <strong>Paper 2</strong> ] - Open-ended question and real-world scenario question, 50% of the total score<br />
This consists of 10 to 11 <strong>open-ended questions</strong> with the last being a real-world scenario question<br />
<br />
Other than time management, which is a side beneï¬t, and knowing the mark allocation, knowing the requirements will save you a lot of marks.<br />
<br />
You probably made many mistakes and lost heaps of marks due to not paying attention to the question and end up writing the wrong thing or being careless.<br />
<br />
The <strong><a href=""https://www.seab.gov.sg/home/examinations/gce-o-level"" target=""_blank"">Math O-level syllabus</a></strong> clearly states that the omission of essential working will result in the loss of marks. Knowing this, you need to make sure that you write down every single working leading up to the ï¬nal answer.<br />
<br />
It is wrong to assume that the examiner will understand how you got the answer. Check that all workings can be seen by the examiner. As you go through the question, constantly write down the working, even mental ones.<br />
<br />
One trick that is in the paper has to do with <strong>rounding</strong>. You might not think about this too much but always check what the question wants you to round up or down to.<br />
<br />
The standard for all tests is to round the ï¬nal answer up to <strong>3 signiï¬cant ï¬gures</strong> but some questions might call for something else. Examples could be round up to 1 decimal place or round to the nearest hundred.<br />
<br />
This is very simple but sneaky and it could be the difference between an A1 and an A2. Another one of these standards includes <strong>&pi;</strong>. When you come across a question that requires &pi;, use the &pi; symbol that is integrated into your calculator to solve it unless stated otherwise.<br />
<br />
Sometimes, the question might speciï¬cally tell you to use 3.14 or 22/7. As mentioned previously, ï¬nd out if they want the answer to be in &pi; or the traditional 3 signiï¬cant ï¬gures.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">2. <strong>Self notes</strong><br />
<br />
Many teachers and schools usually provide notes that can be very helpful when you are revising your work.<br />
<br />
<strong><em>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong!</em></strong><br />
<br />
Those notes should not be thrown away and should be safely stored in a way that it isn&rsquo;t a hassle to try and ï¬nd it but it also isn&rsquo;t with you every time until there is a risk of you losing it.<br />
<br />
These notes that your teachers give you can be very intimidating and it can also be daunting to go through. You might have a gigantic pile of these notes and sometimes you might not know where to start to worse yet, how to start.<br />
<br />
This is why I think that every student should <strong>create their notes</strong>. Don&rsquo;t worry, you don&rsquo;t have to be an artist and make notes like how &lsquo;professionals&rsquo; do. What I&rsquo;m trying to say is you don&rsquo;t have to have an <a href=""https://www.apple.com/sg/ipad/"" target=""_blank""><strong>iPad and an Apple pencil</strong></a> to do it. </span></p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><span style=""color:#e74c3c""><em><strong><span style=""font-size:18px"">A piece of paper, a pen, and a highlighter will sufï¬ce.</span></strong></em></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">There are many videos out there on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/"" target=""_blank""><strong>YouTube</strong></a> that tell you how they take notes and most of the time they would print out their notes and have nice handwriting. It&rsquo;s totally ï¬ne if you don&rsquo;t have a printer and nice handwriting as long as you can read it.<br />
<br />
Your notes do not have to be shown to anyone and can be kept to yourself so it does not matter whether the notes are nice or not. Creating your own notes mean that you can means that you can <strong>start small and work your way from the start to the end</strong>.<br />
<br />
This all abides with your own pace so you can work faster or slower if you want. Creating your notes works the best with <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/maths-tuition"" target=""_blank""><strong>Maths and Science</strong></a> for that matter. Many of the formulae that you will need the exam are not on the paper so memorizing your notes is also important.<br />
<br />
Another beneï¬t of having your own notes means that you can make it as elaborate as you want and as small as wanted. So, you can have a <strong>glance at it right before you enter the exam room</strong> when walking or taking the bus to school.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">3. <strong>The ï¬rst part of a question</strong><br />
<br />
The ï¬rst part of the question is usually the <strong>easier</strong> one. If the time that you allocated to each question is, for example, <strong>5 minutes</strong>, then don&rsquo;t go over that.<br />
<br />
Rather than focusing all your time and effort on that speciï¬c question only to go over time and not be able to ï¬nish the other easier ones, <u>complete the easier ï¬rst part of the question</u> and gain the marks those marks ï¬rst.<br />
<br />
After you have gone through answering all the questions, sift through the paper again and answer the hard ones. It is more beneï¬cial to you if you answer the ï¬rst part and move on than waste all your energy on the second part.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">4. <strong>Asking for help</strong><br />
<br />
Some of the tips that I have mentioned can help you prepare for your <strong>O-level Maths examination</strong> while others take place when you are already taking the exam. Asking for help is one that occurs beforehand.<br />
<br />
Once you have identiï¬ed what are your weak points and what topics you have to work on, take action.<br />
<br />
Nothing is going to happen if you know what you are bad at but continue to go about your revision as if you didn&#39;t know that.</span></p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/request-tutor"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""Maths Tuition"" src=""https://tutorcity.sg/admin_tutor/attachments/uploads/Singapore_Maths_Tuition.jpg"" style=""height:260px; width:350px"" /></a></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">Once you have information, use it. Some people that you can ask for help are your <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/search-tutors/14414"" target=""_blank""><strong>teachers</strong></a>. They know you best when they teach you the subject and they also know what you are going through. They know the subject the most and they know how to effectively help you.<br />
<br />
If you are in a pandemic or maybe just a long holiday break and you can&rsquo;t get in touch with your teachers then your <strong>friends</strong> are next. Your friends also study the same topics as you so even though they might not be able to teach you as well, they would be your next move. Next would be your parents and the internet.<br />
<br />
Chances are that somebody else has the same problem as you before and now know the <strong>solution</strong> to it. Try to reach out to that person and ask him to share with you what he or she had learned.<br />
<br />
I mentioned parents the last because unless they are a <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/maths-tuition"" target=""_blank""><strong>Maths teacher</strong></a>, they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to accurately help you and give you useful tips.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">5. <strong>Sleep</strong><br />
<br />
Sleep is very important, more important than you think it is, especially for Maths where you have to memorize different functions, equations, and formulae.<br />
<br />
Sleep helps you to memorize better and turn all the things that you have learned that day to stone. I recommend that you <a href=""https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/sleep-requirements#:~:text=Most%20adults%20need%207%20to,hours%20of%20sleep%20than%20usual."" target=""_blank""><strong>get 8 hours of sleep</strong></a> so that your mind has enough time to store all the information.<br />
<br />
<u>Sleep is better than studying at night</u>. When you study at night, you might be able to learn and cover more topics and ground but the next morning, you won&rsquo;t be able to remember anything.<br />
<br />
The brain is <strong>less effective at retaining information</strong> at night but in the end, it comes down to your decision. Would you rather be able to remember 1 more point in your notes or be awake and energized in the morning to be able to remember 15 points.<br />
<br />
If you are constantly sleeping for only 5 or 6 hours a day, taking a big leap to 8 hours a day is not good. It is better to slowly adjust over some time so that you get use to it. Moving forward your bedtime by 10 minutes a day is acceptable.<br />
<br />
Stick to your <strong>bedtime routine</strong> too. Remember to set an alarm so that when it goes off, stop what you are doing and make your way to bed. How you sleep is also vital because the quality of your sleep is also a factor.<br />
<br />
I suggest relaxing your mind before sleeping. How many times do you want to sleep but end up staring at your ceiling wall because you can&rsquo;t?<br />
<br />
Playing a piece of simple relaxing <strong>music</strong> that puts you to sleep is an idea that works very well, so does listening to a calm song. <strong>Reading</strong> is also effective, as long as you don&rsquo;t read something that is so suspenseful that you can&rsquo;t put it down.<br />
<br />
6. <strong>Stay in good health</strong><br />
<br />
There&rsquo;s no doubt that food can help you energize your body and stay in shape. Especially when tackling Maths problems, you need to keep yourself <strong>mentally fresh and awake</strong>.<br />
<br />
Remember to eat regular meals at regular times so that you don&rsquo;t get distracted by hunger when studying. Drink tons of water, <strong><a href=""https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-much-water-should-you-drink-per-day#:~:text=There%20are%20many%20different%20opinions,is%20very%20easy%20to%20remember."" target=""_blank"">8 to 10 glasses should be sufï¬cient</a></strong>, you wouldn&rsquo;t want to feel dehydrated and light-headed during your test. Water also helps you to stay focused and alert so drink up.<br />
<br />
Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables and restrict the number of processed foods and sugary drinks you consume. Other than eating and watching your input, you also need to watch out if your body is outputting anything.<br />
<br />
Eating too much is never good so you&rsquo;ll have to exercise too. It is wrong to think that exercise isn&rsquo;t important and that studying should be the main priority because ultimately, being balanced is the main priority.<br />
<br />
If you aren&rsquo;t balanced, all your work could be ï¬ushed down the drain with a mental breakdown. What follows after that is a complete loss of motivation. <strong>Exercising at least 3 times a week</strong> for 30 to 40 minutes is the recommended time.</span></p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>...</strong></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">There you have it.

<br />
<span style=""font-size:18px"">Crafting a good geography essay require <strong>critical thinking skills</strong> and <strong>content knowledge</strong>; Something&nbsp;most students in Singapore find it difficult to master.<br />
<br />
We have summarised <strong>6 key strategies on how to score A for Geography</strong>&nbsp;from our top Geography teachers around Singapore:</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">1. <strong>Knowing the exam format and requirements</strong><br />
<br />
First of all, you need to familiarise with the exam format, which includes knowing the <strong>structure</strong> of the paper and how many marks are in each section.<br />
<br />
This will help you with time management in the Geography exam;&nbsp;you can&nbsp;<strong>allocate time more effectively</strong> for each section so that you don&rsquo;t end up spending too much time on one and end up not ï¬nishing another.</span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:18px"">For O-level Geography, these are the 2 papers: â¨<br />
<br />
[ <strong>Paper 1</strong> ] - 2 sections of structured questions, 50% of the total score<br />
<br />
Section A is a compulsory question on Geographical investigations based on the topics Coasts / Global Tourism. Advised to spend 55 minutes here and its worth 25 marks.<br />
<br />
Section B are 2 structured questions of the same topics where you choose 1 of it.&nbsp;Advised to spend 45 minutes here and its worth 25 marks.<br />
<br />
Total Duration = 1 hour 40 minutes<br />
<br />
[ <strong>Paper 2</strong> ] - 2 sections of structured questions, 50% of the total score<br />
<br />
Section A has 2 questions and you choose 1 of it, the topics are based on Living with Techtonic Hazards / Variable Weather and Changing Climate.&nbsp;Advised to spend 45 minutes here and its worth 25 marks.<br />
Sec<br />
<br />
Section B&nbsp;has 2 questions and you choose 1 of it, the topics are based on Food Resources / Health and Diseases.&nbsp;Advised to spend 45 minutes here and its worth 25 marks.<br />
Sec<br />
<br />
Total Duration = 1 hour 30 minutes</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">2. <strong>Customised notes</strong><br />
<br />
Many teachers and schools usually provide notes that can be very helpful when you are revising your work, however these are usually large piles of papers and it is almost impossible to memorise them.<br />
<br />
It is recommended that every Secondary student should <strong>create their own customised notes</strong>.<br />
<br />
You don&rsquo;t have to be an artist and make notes like how &lsquo;professional graphic writers do&#39;, neither do you need an&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.apple.com/sg/ipad/"" target=""_blank""><strong>iPad and an Apple pencil</strong></a> to do it. </span></p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><span style=""color:#e74c3c""><em><strong><span style=""font-size:18px"">A piece of paper, a pen, and a highlighter will sufï¬ce.</span></strong></em></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">You can get some ideas from&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/"" target=""_blank""><strong>YouTube</strong></a> that teaches you how they take notes and most of the time they would print out their notes and have nice handwriting. As long as you can read it, it doesn&#39;t matter about how bad your handwriting is.<br />
<br />
Another good point about creating your own notes mean that you can means that you can <strong>start from wherever you want and build up the way you like it&nbsp;to the end</strong>.<br />
<br />
Another beneï¬t of having your own notes means is that you can make it portable and&nbsp;have a glance at it right at any time or even before you enter the exam room.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">3. <strong>Improve your English &amp; Argumentative skills</strong></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">You must learn how to reason, persuade and <strong>argue constructively</strong>. Not just memorise and list out everything on what you recall.<br />
<br />
Every question is different, so you need to customise your arguments to fit into the essay.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Polish Your English - Watch your grammar and spelling. Improve your tone, diction, sentence structure. You wouldn&#39;t want to lose marks from a misspelled word or poor grammar that has another meaning that misleads the examiner.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">4. <strong>Asking a Geography expert to help</strong><br />
<br />
Once you have identiï¬ed what are your weak points and what topics you have difficulties in, get someone to help you sort out your doubts.<br />
<br />
You need time to prepare for your <strong>O-level Geography&nbsp;examination</strong>&nbsp;and getting your doubts cleared help you revise better when you make notes too.<br />
<br />
You can also ask your&nbsp;<strong><a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/geography-tuition"" target=""_blank"">school teachers</a>&nbsp;</strong>for help if they have time after school hours.&nbsp;They know the subject the most and they know how to effectively help you since they see you week in week out.</span></p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/request-tutor"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""Geography O level tutors"" src=""https://tutorcity.sg/admin_tutor/attachments/uploads/Geography_O_level_tutors.jpg"" style=""height:250px; width:380px"" /></a></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">If you are in a lockdown&nbsp;or&nbsp;you can&rsquo;t get in touch with your teachers then your <strong>friends</strong> are next. Your friends also study the same topics as you so even though they might not be able to teach you as well, they would be your next move. If they cannot help you, seeking help from free online resources would be next, or asking your parents.<br />
<br />
I mentioned parents the last because unless they are a <strong><a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/geography-tuition"" target=""_blank"">Geography tutor</a></strong>, they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to accurately help you and guide you to an A1.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">5. <strong>Sleep</strong><br />
<br />
Sleep is very important, especially for Geography where you have to recall many facts, data and names of geographical locations.<br />
<br />
I recommend that you <a href=""https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/sleep-requirements#:~:text=Most%20adults%20need%207%20to,hours%20of%20sleep%20than%20usual."" target=""_blank""><strong>get 8 hours of sleep</strong></a> so that your mind has enough time to store all the information, make notes and digest the definitions or names of places.<br />
<br />
If you are constantly sleeping for only 5 or 6 hours a day, taking a big leap to 8 hours a day is not good. It is better to slowly adjust over some time so that you get use to it. <strong>Moving forward your bedtime</strong> by 10 minutes a day is acceptable. Read this article to learn more on <u><strong><a href=""http://www.sleepadvisor.org/how-much-sleep-do-i-need/"" target=""_blank"">how much sleep do you actually need</a></strong></u>.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">6. <strong>Be&nbsp;healthy</strong><br />
<br />
You must&nbsp;regular meals at&nbsp;so that you don&rsquo;t get distracted by hunger when studying, and also drink lots of water.&nbsp;<strong><a href=""https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-much-water-should-you-drink-per-day#:~:text=There%20are%20many%20different%20opinions,is%20very%20easy%20to%20remember."" target=""_blank"">8 to 10 glasses should be sufï¬cient</a></strong>, you wouldn&rsquo;t want to get dehydrated and faint during your exam.<br />
<br />
Another tip is to eat plenty of fruits and vegetables&nbsp;to get enough fibre and daily bowel movement. Do regular exercise to keep metabolism up and a good run often gives you a fresh mind later on.&nbsp;<strong>Exercising at least 3 times a week</strong>&nbsp;is a good way to keep healthy.</span></p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>...</strong></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">These 6 ways can help you do better in your <strong><a href=""https://www.seab.gov.sg/home/examinations/gce-o-level"" target=""_blank"">O-level Geography examinations</a></strong>.&nbsp;Follow these steps to get the desired grade you want for the O levels.<br />

","growth mindset,parenting,kindergarten,preschool","Building_a_Growth_Mindset_in_Your_Child.jpg","<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">While people desire a wide variety of things to be true for themselves, it can be said with confidence that all of us want to live successful and happy lives - so much so that the fear of not living successful and happy lives is just as common.<br />
<br />
This competing interchange between hope and fear begins at an <strong>early age</strong>, and deeply influences our actions, decisions, and outcomes.<br />
<br />
<strong><a href=""https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/3-4-singapore-students-fear-failure-higher-global-average-oecd-study"" target=""_blank"">According to a 2019 OECD study</a></strong>, three out of every four Singaporean students fear academic failure and believe that with failure comes doubts about their future prospects. For reference, the average for the 37 OECD countries was closer to one out of every two students sharing the same fears. <strong>Singaporean children, unfortunately, are more likely than their OECD peers to fear failure</strong>.<br />
<br />
Much of this relates to the ways in which students and children more generally have been taught to view their successes and failures by the ways the adults in their lives treat both inevitable realities.<br />
<br />
American Psychologist <strong>Carol Dweck</strong> believes that the way adults respond to successes and failures plays a key role in the sort of mindset children develop. Her research and that of her colleagues suggests that <strong><a href=""https://youtu.be/hiiEeMN7vbQ"" target=""_blank"">developing a growth mindset</a></strong> can radically reposition the ways in which our children view themselves, their potential, and their journey toward the success and happiness they desire in their own lives.</span></p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><span style=""color:#e74c3c""><strong><span style=""font-size:18px"">You may be wondering, wow! That sounds great, but maybe a little too good to be true. Why haven&rsquo;t I heard of this before?</span></strong></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">A &lsquo;<strong>Growth Mindset</strong>&rsquo; is still relatively new in the field of education and the <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/blog/how-to-motivate-your-child-to-study"" target=""_blank""><strong>realities of parenting</strong></a>; though the related ideas and strategies have been around forever, they&rsquo;re just now gaining in popularity.</span></p>

<p><br />
<span style=""font-size:18px"">Thankfully, developing a growth mindset in your child is <strong>relatively easy</strong> to learn how to do.<br />
<br />
This article will both paint a clear picture of what a growth mindset is and provide four actionable ways to help develop a growth mindset in your child.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>[ What is a Growth Mindset? ]</strong><br />
<br />
Having a growth mindset, as <strong><a href=""https://hbr.org/2016/01/what-having-a-growth-mindset-actually-means"" target=""_blank"">defined by Carol Dwek herself</a></strong>, simply means that an individual believes in their capacity to develop talents, skills, and abilities.<br />
<br />
According to her research, people who believe in their capacity to change and grow over time experience higher levels of success and happiness than people who have &lsquo;<strong>fixed mindsets</strong>.&rsquo;<br />
<br />
These people believe the opposite about their talents, skills, and abilities - that they are static things, unaffected by effort and perseverance, largely determined by gifts or grace.<br />
<br />
Much of the difference in these types of mindsets has to do with <strong>how people respond to challenges</strong> in their lives.<br />
<br />
When students, for example, fail a test or receive a low mark on an assignment, their reaction to the results is indicative of the sort of mindset they possess. <strong>Reframing</strong> the way we look at challenges is essential for changing the ways in which we respond.<br />
<br />
Take the following challenges for example, and note the difference in the ways the challenge is responded to.</span><br />

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">By changing the way children think about the <strong>success and failur</strong>e, we can empower them to persevere through the inevitable obstacles they will face.<br />
<br />
Someone with a growth mindset embraces challenges, believes in themselves, knows they can <strong><a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/blog/self-guided-learning-best-3-e-learning-resources"" target=""_blank"">adapt and learn</a></strong>, and puts their best effort forward, no matter what. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>[ 4 ways to build a growth mindset in your child ]</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>1. Reward and praise effort - not just results. </strong><br />
<br />
When children are only rewarded for crossing the finish line, they learn that success is the only thing worthy of <strong>recognition</strong> - and, when they inevitably fail and receive diminished recognition, <u>they internalize an idea of inferiority, of not being enough.</u><br />
<br />
People fail for all kinds of reasons, all of the time, and most failure doesn&rsquo;t have to do with any sort of <strong>deficiency</strong> or problem with the person failing.<br />
<br />
Praising <strong>hard work</strong> will give them the confidence to know that their effort was enough, and will encourage them to continue putting forth their best effort and seek ways to improve and succeed in the future.<br />
<br />
<strong>2. Frame failure as a learning opportunity. </strong><br />
<br />
In each failure or setback there is a chance to <u><strong>reflect</strong></u>. It&rsquo;s not often that failures are filled with total shortcomings. </span></p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><span style=""color:#e74c3c""><em><strong><span style=""font-size:18px"">In each failed attempt to achieve, there is a chance to both highlight what your child did well. </span></strong></em></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">In calling attention to what they did well, children are more receptive to looking at the things they didn&rsquo;t do so well, and are encouraged to improve by knowing that they are closer than their failure may indicate.<br />
<br />
<strong>3. Emphasize the word YET. </strong><br />
<br />
&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t <strong><a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/maths-tuition"" target=""_blank"">learned that equation</a></strong> <strong>YET</strong>, but you will if you keep practicing.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how to ride a bike <strong>YET</strong>, but you can learn if you keep trying.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
Children need <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/request-tutor"" target=""_blank""><strong>motivation,&nbsp;from a parent, relative, teacher or private tutor</strong></a>, and an easy way to show them the light at the end of the tunnel is to encourage them that it&rsquo;s within their reach.<br />
<br />
<strong>4. Make failure acceptable. </strong><br />
<br />
Whether we like it or not, failure is unavoidable. It&rsquo;s something everyone will deal with - most of us pretty frequently.<br />
<br />
<strong>Embracing failure</strong> is key to overcoming the fear of failure, and central to what it means to have a growth mindset.<br />
<br />
By treating it as something unavoidable, children can exchange their fear of failure for a desire to interrogate and overcome it.&nbsp;</span></p>

<br />
Apart from the core subjects like English, Mother Tongue and Mathematics, there are students who are also on the way to taking the <strong><a href=""https://www.seab.gov.sg/docs/default-source/national-examinations/syllabus/olevel/2020syllabus/7175_y20_sy.pdf"" target=""_blank"">GCE O level exam for POA (Principles of Accounts)</a></strong>.<br />
<br />
If you are one of those then I would encourage you to read this article, where I will share with you a few key steps&nbsp;that you can take to do better in <strong>O-level POA</strong>.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">1. <strong>Knowing the Exam Format</strong><br />
<br />
To do well&nbsp;for POA, you need to know the exam format for a start.&nbsp;This includes knowing the structure of the paper and how many marks are in each section.<br />
<br />
Knowing how many marks in each section will help you with time management in the exam,&nbsp; so you can&nbsp;<strong>allocate time more effectively</strong> for each section so that you don&rsquo;t end up spending too much time on one and end up not ï¬nishing another.</span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:18px"">For O-level Principles of Accounts, these are the 2 papers&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[ <strong>Paper 1</strong> ] - Structured Questions, 40% of the total score<br />
This consists of 3-4&nbsp;<strong>compulsory</strong> structured&nbsp;questions and total of 40 marks.<br />
Duration = 1 hour<br />
<br />
[ <strong>Paper 2</strong> ] - Structured Questions, 60% of the total score<br />
This consists of 2 sections.<br />
Section A consist of 3 compulsory structured questions. One of which is the preparation of a financial statement that carries 20 marks. The other 2 questions are 14 marks each.<br />
Section B consist of 2 questions and you choose 1.<br />
Duration = 2&nbsp;hours</span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:10px""><strong><em>Source:&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.seab.gov.sg/home/examinations/gce-o-level"">https://www.seab.gov.sg/home/examinations/gce-o-level</a></em></strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:18px"">The 2 papers will test students on various areas:<br />
+ Knowledge &amp; Comprehension<br />
+&nbsp;Application<br />
+ Analysis<br />
+&nbsp;Synthesis and Evaluation<br />
<br />
The use of calculators are <strong><u>allowed</u></strong> for both papers.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">2. <strong>Create Your Own Notes</strong><br />
<br />
Many teachers and schools usually provide lecture and revision materials that can be very helpful when you are preparing for the O level <strong>POA examinations.</strong><br />
<br />
However, these notes that your teachers give you are often voluminous&nbsp;and it can also be <strong>challenging</strong> to memorise everything in detail.<br />
<br />
You might have a big stack of papers, diagrams, graphs, definition lists, so many students don&#39;t&nbsp;not know where to start to worse yet, how to start.</span></p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><span style=""color:#e74c3c""><em><strong><span style=""font-size:18px"">I would recommend that every student should learn how to&nbsp;create their notes. </span></strong></em></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">You don&#39;t have make notes that your friends make which look very pro and neat.&nbsp;You don&#39;t need an&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.apple.com/sg/ipad/"" target=""_blank""><strong>iPad and an Apple pencil</strong></a>! Just a&nbsp;piece of paper, a pen, and a highlighter will sufï¬ce.<br />
<br />
And as long as its in your own handwriting and <strong>your own words</strong>, it can be messy but you will know exactly what it means and where to find in your stack of papers.<br />
<br />
Creating your own notes also mean you can <strong>start small and work your way from the start to the end</strong>.&nbsp;This can suit your own pace so you can work faster or slower if you want.<br />
<br />
This also works the best with POA&nbsp;as many of the <strong>formula, data charts, definition list</strong>&nbsp;that you will need the exam are not on the paper so memorizing your notes is also important.<br />
<br />
One more beneï¬t of creating your own notes means that you can make it as complicated&nbsp;as you want and as small as you wish. So, you can have a <strong>look at it right before you enter the exam room,</strong>&nbsp;or when walking to the bus-stop, sitting in the MRT or a free pocket of time at any other place.</span></p>

     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">3. <strong>Focus on weaker topics</strong><br />
<br />
You should spend more time practicing and looking at answer schemes for your <strong>weaker</strong> topics, before moving on to your stronger ones. Many other students like to do more on their stronger topics as its less painful.<br />
<br />
E.g. If I am weaker in profitability or liquidity ratios, I would refer to the answer schemes from ten-year series and learn how to <strong>plan my essay better</strong>. I will also do more practices on calculating the ratios, profit margins, non current assest, accruals.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">4. <strong>Get Help From Other People</strong><br />
<br />
Some of the steps above can help you prepare for your <strong>O-level POA examination</strong> while others take place when you are already taking the exam.<br />
<br />
Once you have identiï¬ed what are your weak points and what topics you have to work on, <u>take action</u>.</span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:18px"">Some people that you can ask for help are your <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/search-tutors/14511"" target=""_blank""><strong>POA school teachers.</strong></a></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:18px"">They know your weak points&nbsp;best because they teach you the subject and they also know what you are going through. Ask them for extra worksheets or remedial lessons after school to help you clarify your doubts.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:18px"">If&nbsp;you can&rsquo;t get extra help&nbsp;with your teachers then your <strong>friends</strong> are next. Organise group sessions with those who are good in POA and willing to help you. Sometimes, a friend can explain <strong>concepts</strong> in a way that you can understand better compared to your teacher. Or they can provide you some <strong>notes</strong> which you missed out in class when you were absent or drifting off.<br />
<br />
Should both options above be unavailable, seek help from <strong><a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/"" target=""_blank"">online agencies</a> </strong>or tuition centres which provide crash courses in POA revision.<br />
<br />
Spending a bit of money is unavoidable at this late stage and often a <strong><a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/poa-tuition"" target=""_blank"">good POA tutor</a></strong> can help you make the difference between a D grade and a B/A grade.</span><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/request-tutor"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""POA tuition singapore"" src=""https://tutorcity.sg/admin_tutor/attachments/uploads/POA_Accounting_Tuition.jpg"" style=""border-style:solid; border-width:1px; height:260px; width:350px"" /></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">5.&nbsp;<strong>Get Enough Rest</strong></span></p>

<p><br />
<span style=""font-size:18px"">Sleep helps you to memorize better and I recommend that you <a href=""https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/sleep-requirements#:~:text=Most%20adults%20need%207%20to,hours%20of%20sleep%20than%20usual."" target=""_blank""><strong>get at least 8 hours of sleep</strong></a> so that your mind is fresh enough&nbsp;to process all the accounting ratios, formulas and information.<br />
<br />
Our human brain is <strong>less effective at retaining information</strong> at night so don&#39;t burn the midnight oil! Would you prefer to memorise&nbsp;1 more point in your notes or be&nbsp;energized in the morning to be able to digest 15 formulas?<br />
<br />
<strong>Sleep is better than studying at night</strong>. Most of the time, you won&rsquo;t be able to remember anything the next morning on the things you covered the night before.<br />
<br />
Moving forward your bedtime by 10 minutes a day is acceptable rather than&nbsp;taking a big leap to 8 hours a day&nbsp; which is difficult to&nbsp;adjust over some time so that you get used to it.<br />
<br />
How you sleep is also vital because the having a <a href=""https://www.sleepfoundation.org/press-release/what-good-quality-sleep"" target=""_blank""><strong>good&nbsp;quality of your sleep</strong></a> is also a factor so I suggest relaxing your mind before sleeping. How many times do you want to sleep but end up staring at your ceiling wall because you can&rsquo;t?<br />
<br />
Listening to some <strong>relaxing music</strong> that puts you to sleep is an idea that works very well for many people, or you <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/blog/best-books-to-read"" target=""_blank""><strong>read a good book</strong></a>&nbsp;which is also effective, as long as you don&rsquo;t read something that is so suspenseful that you can&rsquo;t put it down.<br />
<br />
6. <strong>Keep in shape!</strong><br />
<br />
Stay in shape by eating well and exercise regularly so that you can&nbsp;keep yourself <strong>mentally fresh and awake</strong>.<br />
<br />
Eat your meals at regular intervals&nbsp;so that you don&rsquo;t get distracted by hunger when studying. Drink a minimum of&nbsp;<strong><a href=""https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-much-water-should-you-drink-per-day#:~:text=There%20are%20many%20different%20opinions,is%20very%20easy%20to%20remember."" target=""_blank"">8 to 10 glasses of water daily</a></strong>, as you wouldn&rsquo;t get dehydrated and faint while studying for long hours. For fibre intake, eat plenty of fruits and vegetables to get your bowels moved regularly.<br />
<br />
You&rsquo;ll have to exercise to keep the metabolism up!&nbsp;Exercise is important because being balanced is the main priority. If you aren&rsquo;t balanced, all your studying could be ï¬ushed down the drain with a physical or mental&nbsp;breakdown.<br />
<br />
<strong><a href=""https://www.healthxchange.sg/fitness-exercise/exercise-tips/exercise-guidelines-how-much-exercise-enough"" target=""_blank"">Spend&nbsp;30 minutes exercising for each session, for at least 3 times a week should be enough</a></strong>, to make sure your blood flow is regulated and your body healthy to tackle the O level exams.</span></p>

<br />
There are students struggling with Mother Tongue, notable for Chinese or Higher Chinese,<strong> scoring D7 to F9 all year round</strong>. If you fall into one of these categories, taking the GCE O level examination would cause you many late nights catching up with what you fall short in.<br />
<br />
Here are some important strategies&nbsp;that you can take to do better in <strong>O-level Chinese and Higher Chinese</strong>.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">1. <strong>Different formats for Chinese or Higher Chinese</strong><br />
<br />
To do well&nbsp;for Chinese, you have to familiarise yourself with the different structures of the paper and how many marks are in each section so that you can do proper&nbsp;time management - <strong>allocate time more effectively</strong> for each section so that you don&#39;t overcommit on one part and leave out another important section.<br />
<br />
There are 3 papers you will need to sit for in Chinese or Higher Chinese.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">2. <strong>Make Your Own Notes</strong><br />
<br />
Your teacher will provide plenty of revision materials so that you can prepare&nbsp;for the O level <strong>Chinese or Higher Chinese examinations.</strong><br />
<br />
However, these notes that your teachers give you are likely to be huge stacks of papers&nbsp;and it can get rather daunting&nbsp;to <strong>organise</strong> and sort&nbsp;everything to your liking.<br />
<br />
You might have a big stack of reading lists, comprehension papers, assessment papers, worksheets,&nbsp;so many students find it hard to get started.</span></p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><span style=""color:#e74c3c""><em><strong><span style=""font-size:18px"">I believe that every student should customise and create their own notes. </span></strong></em></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">As long as its in your <strong>own words</strong>, it can get as messy as you want&nbsp;but you will know exactly what they mean and organise in a way you can retrieve it easily later.<br />
<br />
One more beneï¬t of creating your own notes is the convenience of reference. You can have a <strong>quick glance at them just before the exam</strong>&nbsp;or when you are sitting in the library waiting for someone, or having a quick meal at the tuckshop.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">3. <strong>Read... A LOT!</strong><br />
<br />
You should spend more time reading every day to build your interest in the language.<strong> Reading aloud </strong>helps with fluency and and indirectly helps in comprehension / cloze passage in paper 2, as well as your Paper 3 Oral.<br />
<br />
If you want to memorise model essays, then read aloud the model essays.<br />
<br />
If you like reading Chinese newspapers or blog posts, read them aloud too. Of course, do it when no one is around!<br />
<br />
Diana Ser has a lot of useful tips on how to incorporate Chinese into your daily&nbsp;activities, visit her blog at&nbsp;<strong><a href=""http://www.dianaser.com/"" target=""_blank"">http://www.dianaser.com/</a></strong></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">4. <strong>Get Help From Others</strong><br />
<br />
Upon identifying your weak areas or&nbsp;topics you have to work on, <u>take action</u>.&nbsp;The strategies above can help you prepare for your O-level Chinese / <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/higher-chinese-tuition"" target=""_blank"">Higher Chinese </a>examination but you will need external help if you still cannot resolve certain pain points.</span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:18px"">The first person you should seek&nbsp;help from are your <strong><a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/search-tutors/14564"" target=""_blank"">Chinese school teachers.</a>&nbsp;</strong>This is because your Chinese teachers would know where are your weak areas and how to help you overcome them.</span><br />
<span style=""font-size:18px"">Ask them for extra worksheets or remedial lessons after school to help you clarify your doubts.</span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:18px"">If your teachers are too busy and have no time to help you, then you have to target&nbsp;your <strong>friends who are very strong in Chinese</strong>. Organise study groups with 2-4 friends who willing to help you.<br />
<br />
Sometimes, a friend can explain things&nbsp;in ways which you can <strong>digest better</strong> compared to your teacher. Or they can provide you with materials, online resources, tips from other experts or websites.<br />
<br />
However, should both options be impossible to organise,&nbsp;get advice from&nbsp;<strong><a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/"" target=""_blank"">tuition agencies</a> </strong>or tuition centres who have good Chinese tutors and can provide materials.<br />
<br />
It would be better to spend some money now to get a <strong><a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/chinese-tuition"" target=""_blank"">good Chinese&nbsp;tutor</a></strong>&nbsp;to improve your grades at the last minute, cos this could mean the difference between a C grade and a A grade.</span><br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">5.&nbsp;<strong>Online Guides &amp;&nbsp;Free Exam Papers</strong></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">Most students use past years exam papers to practice because this gives them&nbsp;the confidence to solve&nbsp;questions which may repeat themselves every year, and it improves the time management skills as it gives you an idea how long it takes to solve each question.<br />
<br />
If you cannot find other resources and need more practice, here are some sites you can download past year papers, comprehension worksheets from top schools:<br />

<br />
<strong>Having a strong foundation in English would open more doors to university courses, A-level subjects and overall&nbsp;better communication with people.</strong><br />
<br />
At the end of every academic year, graduating students would face hectic schedules in revising their work, most would be ploughing through every subject&#39;s&nbsp;<strong><a href=""https://www.openschoolbag.com.sg/blog/category/academic/ten-year-series/"" target=""_blank"">ten-year series</a></strong>, their teachers&#39; worksheets and textbooks.<br />

<p><br />
<span style=""font-size:18px"">1. <strong>Know the Marking Scheme and Exam Format</strong><br />
<br />
To do well&nbsp;for English, you have to familiarise yourself with the 4 different papers and its structure, especially how many marks are in each section so that you can <strong>manage your time&nbsp;more effectively</strong>&nbsp;- don&#39;t spend too much effort for one section and give up on the others!<br />
<br />
Here are the 4&nbsp;papers you will need to clear:</span><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">[ <strong>Paper 1</strong> ] - <strong>Writing</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>35%</strong> of the total score<br />
This consists of 3 sections.<br />
Section A is <strong>editing</strong> where students have to identify and edit grammamatical errors in a short written text.<br />
Section B is <strong>situational</strong> writing where you have to write 250-350 words on a visual text situation.<br />
Section C&nbsp;is <strong>continuous</strong> writing of 350-500 words on 1 out of 4 topics.<br />
Duration = 1 hour and 50 minutes</span><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">[ <strong>Paper 2</strong> ] - <strong>Comprehension</strong>, <strong>35%</strong> of the total score<br />
This consists of 3 sections.<br />
Section A is responding to questions on Text 1, a <strong>visual text</strong><br />

Section B is where candidates will listen to a recording <strong>once</strong> and then do a simple note-taking exercise<br />
Duration =&nbsp;About 45&nbsp;mins</span><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">[ <strong>Paper 4</strong>&nbsp;] -&nbsp;<strong>Oral Communication</strong>, <strong>20%</strong> of the total score (This paper is only for School candidates)<br />
This consists of 2&nbsp;parts.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">2. <strong>Customising Your Own Notes</strong><br />
<br />
Your English <strong>school teacher</strong> will give you lots of worksheets and assessment papers or exam papers to help you ready yourself to sit for the year-end&nbsp;O level English&nbsp;examinations<strong>.</strong><br />
<br />
The materials will consist of large piles of comprehension papers, model answers, personalised notes&nbsp;and it can get <strong>very frustrating to read through everything</strong>, digest them and re-organise them to suit your studying habits.</span></p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><span style=""color:#e74c3c""><em><strong><span style=""font-size:18px"">So I believe that every student should rewrite and recreate their own notes. </span></strong></em></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">It has to be written in your <strong>own words and your style</strong>, even if your handwriting is like chicken scratchings its okay because you understand them and can recall them better when you need during the examination.<br />
<br />
One more beneï¬t of creating your own notes is the <strong>portability</strong> factor. You can condense the notes into smaller bites so that you can carry them around in your bag or file, then&nbsp;have a <strong>quick glance at them just before the exam</strong>&nbsp;or when you are travelling around on the MRT / bus, or having a coffee at the canteen, or waiting for your friends to arrive.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">3. <strong>Reading Aloud To Improve Your Oral Skills!</strong><br />
<br />
Many past O level students said that reading blog posts, articles, story books every day will&nbsp;build your interest in the language.<br />
<br />
<strong>Reading aloud </strong>helps with fluency and and helps you perform better in oral for paper 4.<br />
<br />
Some advised that if you want to memorise model essays for composition, then read aloud the model essays that you can find. It works just as well.<br />
<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">4. <strong>Planning and Writing</strong><br />
<br />
For <strong>Paper 1</strong>: when you look at the question, identify the <u>key words</u> and common topics which you can use e.g. environment, economy, sports or family issues. Then <a href=""https://creately.com/lp/create-mindmaps-online/"" target=""_blank"">make mind maps</a> to connect and link up the topics to these key words.<br />
<br />
A lot of students don&#39;t plan what they want to write and end up having a <strong>disorganised essay</strong> which confuses the marker on what the topic is all about.<br />
<br />
The most important thing to do first is to <strong>draft an essay plan</strong> by using&nbsp;point form.&nbsp;The easiest way is to think up of 3-4 points, recall some examples and expand on them.<br />
<br />
This will take around 10 minutes but it gives a bird&#39;s eye view on what the structure and flow of your essay will be like.<br />
<br />
For <strong>Paper 2</strong>:&nbsp;the summary question in Section C is where students should try to get full marks for content by just picking out the main points.<br />
<br />
To get as many marks for <strong>style</strong>, link these main ideas with simple conjuctions which should give you around 4 marks out of the 6-7 marks.<br />

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">5. <strong>Get Help From Others</strong><br />
<br />
If you still have weak areas that you still cannot resolve with the strategies above, <u>take action</u>.&nbsp;The steps above can help you prepare for your <strong>O-level English&nbsp;examination</strong> but you will need more assistance so don&#39;t feel shy to ask around.</span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:18px"">The first source that is most convenient to ask help from are your&nbsp;<strong><a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/search-tutors/14571"" target=""_blank"">English School Teachers</a>,&nbsp;</strong>since they are the ones who interact with you week in week out so they know your shortcomings and how to tackle them.</span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:18px"">Try to request for additional materials, model answers, worksheets or stay back after school for extra lessons if they are available.</span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-size:18px"">However, most school teachers are extremely busy expecially pre-exam period so they may not be able to squeeze more time for you.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thus, the next source are your close <strong>friends who are very strong in English</strong>, so try to organise small study groups during weekends or after-school hours.<br />
<br />
Many a time, a friend can explain concepts in a <strong>simpler</strong> way as compared to your school teacher, or a different angle to word or phrase.<br />
<br />
They can also share study notes,&nbsp;other school exam papers, online resources or&nbsp;tips which you didn&#39;t know of!&nbsp;Remember to give them a small treat as a reward for helping you!<br />
<br />
However, should the above options still fail to help, then it would be wise to consult a&nbsp;<strong><a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/"" target=""_blank"">tuition agency</a>&nbsp;</strong>or tuition centres who have <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/english-tuition"" target=""_blank""><strong>good English tutors</strong></a> who may be able to lend you a helping hand.<br />
<br />
Spend some money now&nbsp;to improve your grades pronto!<br />
<br />
<strong>This could mean the difference between a F grade and a A/B grade</strong>, and save you a lot of pain and disappointment later when you receive your results slip.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">Past years exam papers is the de facto method of most secondary students&nbsp;to practice answering the O level questions as this gives them the skills of mapping out how much time to spend for each section and the confidence of handling <strong>repeat questions</strong> which appears in every year&#39;s paper.<br />

<br />
Primary school, secondary school and Pre-University students will return to school in 2 phases:<br />
<br />
<strong>[ Phase 1]</strong><br />
<br />
For the first few weeks of Term 3 starting on 2 June&nbsp;&ndash; <u><strong>Graduating cohorts</strong></u> such as Pri 6, Sec 4 &amp; 5, will be allowed to go to school from Monday to Friday.<br />
<br />
Other cohorts will <strong>rotate weekly</strong> between Home-Based Learning (HBL) and returning to school for lessons.<br />
<br />
For Junior Colleges and Millennia Institute, <strong>50%</strong> of their students to be back in school at any one time to allow students more physical time with their teachers and at the same time, reduce the risk of infection.<br />
<br />
<strong>[ Phase 2]</strong><br />
<br />
All students will return to school from Mondays to Fridays.</span></p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><strong><span style=""font-size:18px"">...</span></strong></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">As we have seen the effects of <a href=""https://www.moe.gov.sg/parentkit"" target=""_blank""><strong>Home-Based Learning (HBL)</strong></a> from the past 3 months, there are some misconceptions from parents and students which needs to be debunked!<br />
<br />
After all, who knows if there will be a 2nd wave of infection or another virus outbreak that shuts all schools again and everyone is back to HBL.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><u><strong>Myth 1</strong></u><br />
<br />
My kid doesn&rsquo;t get enough attention from the teacher!<br />
<br />
Fact:<br />
<br />
There are different tools such as <strong><a href=""https://www.webex.com/"" target=""_blank"">Webex</a>, <a href=""https://zoom.us/"" target=""_blank"">Zoom</a>, <a href=""https://meet.google.com/"" target=""_blank"">Google Meet</a></strong> that allows teachers to use screen-sharing and chat functions to engage your child. Each student will get sufficient attention in class and the teacher will vary the speed of teaching accordingly.<br />
<br />
Teachers also have the option to check back on the students later one using single chat sessions to ensure your child can catch up. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><u><strong>Myth 2</strong></u><br />
<br />
There are too many disruptions in HBL!<br />
<br />
Fact:<br />
<br />
It is true to a certain extent that the <strong>types of disruption&nbsp;</strong>are more when kids are at home as compared to a classroom. But this doesn&rsquo;t mean that there are no disruptions in a classroom either as kids can get rowdy and noisy during lessons in school!<br />
<br />
For online lessons, teachers can <strong>limit</strong> private chats among students and they are also using video to monitor each student&rsquo;s attention.<br />
<br />
Teachers can also use other digital channels to <strong>communicate</strong> with parents for those kids who are notorious and drift off to do other things.<br />
<br />
Parents can monitor their children to make sure they are seated properly and not be playing with their toys etc during the lesson.<br />
<br />
As a parent, you will want to be updated with what your child is learning and his/her performance, so you can better support the <strong>learning environment</strong> at home.<br />
<br />
E.g. if your home has other family members around and it gets noisy, <strong>shift the place</strong> to yours or your child&rsquo;s bedroom for the lesson. Or should your child need extra materials or resources, you can buy them to get ready for the next lesson.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><u><strong>Myth 3</strong></u><br />
<br />
Home-based learning is poorer in quality than Classroom learning<br />
<br />
Fact:<br />
<br />
Be it classroom or online learning, school teachers and private tutors are all committed to deliver their lessons effectively with the <strong>same passion and enthusiasm</strong>.<br />
<br />
In fact, there is 1 distinct <strong>advantage</strong> that online learning has over classroom learning. Most <a href=""https://elearningindustry.com/elearning-platforms-use-online-courses-10""><strong>online learning platforms</strong></a> have a feature that auto-records the lesson and this can be replayed at a later time to allow your child to refer back to the topics which needs more clarification.<br />
<br />
Another advantage is that teachers can use live quizzes and hands-on activities that is <strong>fun and interesting</strong>, which many students find engaging and helps them remember concepts better. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><u><strong>Myth 4</strong></u><br />
<br />
My child is on the computer whole day long!<br />
<br />
Fact:<br />
<br />
Though your child has to spend longer hours in front of the computer, you can mitigate this by planning <strong>short breaks</strong> and even some exercise routines to break the monotony.<br />
<br />
This helps you and your child <strong>stay healthy</strong> during the circuit breaker period and prevents burnout.<br />
<br />
Teachers will also devise a <strong>lesson plan</strong> to rotate between quizzes, interactive worksheets, videos, so as to engage students and keep the lesson vibrant.<br />
<br />
The <strong>screen time can be reduced</strong> as each kid have different speed on completing each section, sometimes the faster ones can take interval breaks when they finish the assignment quickly. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><u><strong>Myth 5</strong></u><br />
<br />
We don&rsquo;t have internet or computer so we cannot have lessons.<br />
<br />
Fact:<br />
<br />
Some families in Singapore have <strong>financial difficulties</strong> and do not have the necessary tools at home for HBL.<br />
<br />
The government is aware of this and has provided assistance where around &lsquo;<strong><a href=""http://https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/home-based-learning-laptops-tablets-students-12613964"" target=""_blank"">3,300 devices loaned out to students following announcement of full home-based learning: Ong Ye Kung</a></strong>&rsquo;<br />
<br />
Around 200 dongles have been loaned out to students who don&rsquo;t have internet access at home.<br />
<br />
&lsquo;<em>Low-income families can also apply for subsidised computers and free broadband through the Infocomm Media Development Authority&rsquo;s (IMDA) NEU PC Plus programme</em>,&#39; he said. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><u><strong>Myth 6</strong></u><br />
<br />
I have to standby at my child&rsquo;s side during the whole lesson<br />
<br />
Fact:<br />
<br />
No, <strong>you don&rsquo;t have to sitting next to your child during the lesson</strong>. Teachers encourage the students to learn independently without parents&rsquo; to sit by the side.<br />
<br />
They will guide your child before each task and will monitor them via <strong>videoconferencing</strong> during the lesson to ensure learning is done effectively.<br />
<br />
Only at times when your child is distracted then you will need to step in to discipline them, or if your child is very young then you need to <strong>guide them at the start</strong> of the lesson to help them settle down.<br />
<br />
If you are not able to help them with their schoolwork, there are professional tutors who can <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/online-tuition"" target=""_blank""><strong>teach your child 1-to-1 via online</strong></a> tools such as Google Meet, Zoom or Webex, and at very <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/tuition-rates"" target=""_blank""><strong>affordable rates depending on the level</strong></a>.<br />
<br />
After the online lessons, you may wish to <strong>play or read with them</strong> so that you can continue their interest in their studies, at the same time you can monitor their progress. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><u><strong>Myth 7</strong></u><br />
<br />
My kid can&rsquo;t keep up with their online lesson<br />
<br />
Fact:<br />
<br />
Each child has <strong>different learning speed</strong>, some slower and some faster than the rest of the cohort, and teachers are well aware of this problem.<br />
<br />
This issue is prevalent in both classroom and <strong>home-based learning</strong> so teachers have to cope with this in their own ways.<br />
<br />
For home-based learning, the <strong>video recording</strong> function will mitigate this problem as slower students can replay the lesson later on to catch up.<br />
<br />
Teachers can also be reached for 1-to-1 coaching via private chats if students need to clarify their doubts.</span></p>

<br />
HBL may last for some time even if it is planned to end after Phase 2.<br />
<br />

<br />
<strong>[ Phase 1 ]</strong><br />
<br />
For the first few weeks of Term 3 starting on 2 June, Pri 6, Sec 4 &amp; 5 (a.k.a. the <strong>graduating</strong> cohorts) will be allowed to go to school from Monday to Friday.<br />
<br />
Other levels cohorts will <strong>rotate weekly</strong> between Home-Based Learning (HBL) and going to school for lessons. For MI and JCs, only half of their students to be back in school at any one time.<br />
<br />
<strong>[ Phase 2 ]&nbsp;</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>All students</strong> will return to school from Mondays to Fridays.<br />
<br />
Whilst it seems that things are returning back to normal, parents have also been asking around for private tutors to start with <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/online-tuition"" target=""_blank""><strong>online tutoring</strong></a> now and convert to face-to-face tuition once home visitations are allowed.<br />
<br />
Here are some misconceptions about <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/request-tutor"" target=""_blank""><strong>private tuition</strong></a> that we hope to clarify during this period of &lsquo;new normal&rsquo;</span></p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><strong>...</strong></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>Myth 1 -&nbsp;Private Tutors are not as effective as school teachers. </strong><br />
<br />
Fact:<br />
<br />
Did you know that there are my current and ex-<strong>MOE teachers</strong> who also double up as private tutors?<br />
<br />
Even if you do not engage them, non-MOE teachers bring with them a wealth of experience and knowledge which they can share with your child in a <strong>1-to-1 setting</strong>.<br />
<br />
A <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/request-tutor"" target=""_blank""><strong>private tutor</strong></a> can focus his/her attention on your child to tackle specific areas of weakness or a topic that your child cannot overcome. Including providing materials/exam papers/worksheets that is accumulated over the years of teaching </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>Myth 2 - Tuition is meant for students getting lousy grades </strong><br />
<br />
Fact:<br />
<br />
Since 2010, we have <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/about-us"" target=""_blank""><strong>helped more than 40,000 parents and students find a tutor</strong></a>.<br />
<br />
Out of these, <strong>38% </strong>are students with above average scores (PSLE B score and above, O level B3 and above, A level B/A grade).<br />
<br />
Thus, private tuition is not merely salvaging poor scoring students, it is also about <strong>maintaining</strong> the existing grade or pushing for the distinction.<br />
<br />
Tutoring is also about <strong>developing the right mindset</strong> and attitude of the child towards learning, both for test scores and the essence of life.<br />
<br />
<a href=""https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/choosing-right-education-lifelong-learning"" target=""_blank""><strong>Learning is a lifelong</strong></a> experience, and this should be imbued into a child from young. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>Myth 3 - I can&rsquo;t change my tutor during the first month! </strong><br />
<br />
Fact:<br />
<br />
Private tuition is&hellip;private! It is a private arrangement between <strong>2 willing parties</strong>, where one provides a tuition service in exchange for monetary rewards.<br />
<br />
At any time, either party can <strong>cease</strong> the service for any reason. So you can stop the tuition if you do not find the tuition suitable and pay for any lessons done.<br />
<br />
<em>Beware of any tutors who tell you otherwise! </em></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>Myth 4 - Tuition adds on to my child&rsquo;s workload </strong><br />
<br />
Fact:<br />
<br />
It is true that students nowadays have so many CCAs and <strong>tuition centres</strong> to attend, music lessons, sports classes like swimming or badminton, their available time slots are very precious and limited.<br />
<br />
On top of that, getting private tutors adding on to their workload is a concern that many parents would have.<br />
<br />
On the flip side, tutors can assist the child to <strong>solve questions in homework</strong> that he/she has got stuck in, or teach certain <strong><a href=""https://sg.theasianparent.com/heuristics"" target=""_blank"">heuristics</a></strong> or <a href=""https://www.noodle.com/articles/10-mnemonic-devices-that-every-elementary-schooler-will-remember"" target=""_blank""><strong>mnemonics</strong></a> to speed up the learning process.<br />
<br />
This would <strong>free up more time</strong> for your child to enjoy other things after completing the homework. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>Myth 5 - Private Tuition is too expensive and not worth it </strong><br />
<br />
Fact:<br />
<br />
<a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/tuition-rates"" target=""_blank""><strong>Home tuition rates</strong></a> go by different tiers depending on the experience and qualifications of the tutor.<br />
<br />
Whilst there are exorbitant rates charged by top-school teachers, many are actually <strong>affordable</strong>! Whether it&rsquo;s worth it or not depends on how much you value your child&rsquo;s future.<br />
<br />
We all know that the top-paying jobs often require high skill-set brought about by a set of qualifications. The other way to get rich is if you are an <strong>entrepreneur</strong> and your business does very well. <em>Or you strike lottery</em>.<br />
<br />
Check out our <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/tuition-rates"" target=""_blank""><strong>latest tuition rates</strong></a> here to find one within your budget. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>Myth 6 - Good tuition is expensive </strong><br />
<br />
Fact:<br />
<br />
The Chinese have a saying: <strong>ä¸åé±ä¸åè´§</strong><br />
<br />
Translated: You get what you pay for.<br />
<br />
Following from the previous myth, <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/tuition-rates"" target=""_blank""><strong>tuition rates vary</strong></a> between the different types of tutors.<br />
<br />
Not everyone can afford to get the top-notch school teachers, but this doesn&rsquo;t mean the <strong>fulltime</strong> tutor or undergraduate cannot deliver results!<br />
<br />
In our experience, <strong>70%-80% </strong>of our matchings are with non-NIE trained teachers every year. Most have excellent reviews and engaged tutors until the final exam. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>Myth 7 - I have to pay in advance </strong><br />
<br />
Fact:<br />
<br />
Private tuition works differently from <a href=""https://blog.moneysmart.sg/family/best-tuition-centres-singapore/"" target=""_blank""><strong>tuition centres</strong></a> who often collects the fees at the beginning of the month.<br />
<br />
Our <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/terms-conditions"" target=""_blank""><strong>Terms &amp; Conditions</strong></a> is to pay only upon completion at the end of the 4th or 8th lesson, or pay-per-lesson depending on each arrangement.<br />
<br />
A very small minority of tutors ask to be paid in advance, and this will <strong>depend</strong> on the parent&rsquo;s comfort level.<br />
<br />
If the tutor has been teaching for a long time, some parents are okay with paying in advance. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>Myth 8 - Tuition is only needed when the final exam is near. </strong><br />
<br />
Fact: A lot of parents and students wait til the last 2 months before panicking and engage a tutor to do crash courses or <strong>intensive</strong> revisions. While this can help salvage some marks, it is not recommended.<br />
<br />
Last-minute revisions place immense stress on the child and the results are often disappointing. We advocate having tuition at the <strong>start of the year</strong> should you find your results to be dismal.<br />
<br />
Build a good <strong>foundation</strong> now so that your child can work towards greater success at later part of the year because that is where the difficult topics are. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />
<br />
We hope that by dispelling the 8 myths, parents can have a good understanding of what <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/search-tutors"" target=""_blank""><strong>private tuition</strong></a> entails and the benefits it brings to your child.<br />

<br />
Reading makes you better at history and science, at learning new languages - at nearly any endeavor you could think of.<br />
<br />
And with just a measly 15 minutes being the basement for making a change, parents have been adept at incorporating <strong>nightly reading routines</strong> into their children&rsquo;s schedules.<br />
<br />
<strong><a href=""https://www.renaissance.com/2018/02/20/blog-interwoven-achievement-reading-science-math/"" target=""_blank"">Math achievement is also correlated with higher reading achievement</a> </strong>and more consistent reading habits - which makes a lot of sense, if you think about it.<br />
<br />
Many math problems incorporate <strong>critical thinking</strong>, require students to digest and connect multiple different pieces of information, and even require students to respond in full sentences (gasp!).<br />
<br />
This only becomes more true as children age, with higher-level subjects in high school and college mixing different disciplines, and many of the most desirable jobs heavily incorporate and intertwine<strong> math and reading skills</strong>.<br />
<br />
Luckily, there&rsquo;s much more parents can do to build <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/maths-tuition"" target=""_blank""><strong>math skills at home</strong></a> with their kindergarden or preschooling children. While we recommend instituting nightly reading routines with your child, studies have shown that making a conscious effort to help them <a href=""https://www.pennsbury.k12.pa.us/pennsbury/Pennsbury/www.pennsbury.k12.pa.us/pennsbury/Departments/Communications/Everyday Mathematics and Parental Involvement.pdf"" target=""_blank""><strong>build their math skills</strong></a>, fluency, and familiarity at home can have a proven and easily replicable impact.<br />
<br />
In this article, we&rsquo;ll introduce several clear steps you can take as a parent to begin or continue making an impact on your child&rsquo;s academic achievement in kindergarten maths.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><u><strong>Changing your Math Mindset</strong></u></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">Last week, we covered what it means to have a <strong><a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/blog/early-childhood-education-building-a-growth-mindset-in-your-child"" target=""_blank"">Growth Mindset</a></strong>. Simply put, it can be summarized as believing in our capacity to improve and change with self-love and hard work.<br />
<br />
Mindsets have a lot to do with the way we all look at the <strong>challenges</strong> in our lives, and Math is no different. It&rsquo;s incredibly common for parents to look at the math homework brought home by their kindergarten kids&nbsp;and think to themselves, how did I ever figure this out? Why don&rsquo;t I remember this?<br />
<br />
It turns out that many of us have <strong>negative mindsets about math</strong> - much of which is tied up in our own fears and struggles around the subject.<br />
<br />
Research suggests that parental ability to aid their students has little to nothing to do with their own proficiency in the subject. <a href=""https://www.youcubed.org/resources/parents-beliefs-math-change-childrens-achievement/"" target=""_blank""><strong>Parental anxiety</strong></a> around math is the biggest determining factor in the mathematical success of their children.<br />
<br />
Much like making the shift to a growth mindset, parent&rsquo;s express their sentiments to their children through the lens of a fixed mindset - saying things like &lsquo;<strong>math is hard</strong>&rsquo; or &lsquo;how did you get that question wrong.&rsquo;<br />
<br />
Changing the way parents think about math and how they convey that <strong>support</strong> to their children is critical to their success.<br />
<br />
An easy first steps for parent&rsquo;s trying to shift their mindsets on math is to review our article on building growth mindsets in children, as the strategies suggested there can be applied at any age starting from K1 or K2 level.</span><span style=""font-size:18px""> </span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><u><strong>Incorporating Math, Everywhere</strong></u></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">Calculating tips is a mathematical exercise. So is: building a shed; building a treehouse; counting the stop signs passed on a drive; cooking; on and on, the sentiment is clear: <strong>Math is everywhere</strong>!!!<br />
<br />
While most parents think the only thing they can do to aid their children is helping them, Tutor City&rsquo;s challenge for parents is to <strong>treat math like the pervasive skill</strong> that it is, and incorporate it as often as they can.<br />
<br />
The <strong>NWEA</strong> has shared a comprehensive list of ways parents can do so (you can view the <a href=""https://www.nwea.org/blog/2018/parent-strategies-for-improving-their-childs-math/"" target=""_blank""><strong>full list here</strong></a>). Here are some of our favorites.</span></p>

+ Compare <strong>prices</strong> of items - prompt them to identify which is more, by how much, etc.<br />
<br />
+ Have them <strong>count literally</strong> anything as you do things together - putting away groceries, collecting toys - anything you can think of. This builds number sense in young children, and can easily be upped to counting by 2s, 5s, 10s, etc.<br />
<br />
+ Make a game out of <strong>measuring</strong> things for fun with a ruler, yardstick, or measuring tape. See who can find the longest or largest item!<br />
<br />
+ <strong>Count</strong> objects, both similar or different, to explain odd/even numbers and ratios. Make <strong>comparisons</strong> between them. Easy and fun to do with candy!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
+&nbsp;<strong>Compare</strong> objects of similar/different shapes, ask them to specifically identify them.<br />
<br />
+ Pose <strong>real word problems</strong> to solve together. For example, you could explain that there are more mirrors in the house than plants, and assist your child in figuring out how many of both there are and in figuring out the difference.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><u><strong>Three Fun Websites to Explore!</strong></u><br />
<br />
As we&rsquo;ve covered previously, sites like <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/blog/self-guided-learning-best-3-e-learning-resources"" target=""_blank""><strong>Khan Academy</strong></a> are an excellent resource for parents looking to help their children become self-guided learners.<br />
<br />
Khan Academy is unmatched in terms of <strong>replicating</strong>&nbsp;preschool mathematics instruction that replicates classroom lessons. However - how much it feels like a real classroom can sometimes lose the interest of some children looking for a break.<br />
<br />
There are dozens of websites that are designed to make learning and math fun - often leading children to forget that they&rsquo;re learning along the way.<br />
<br />
Here are <strong>3 websites</strong> to help your child see math in a new way.<br />
<br />
1. <a href=""https://www.funbrain.com/"" target=""_blank""><strong>Fun Brain</strong></a><br />
<br />
With games and activities broken down by grade, subject, and specific skill, there seems to be an endless number of games for kids to explore.<br />
<br />
Compare equivalent fractions, build grocery lists, and complete skill fluency practice on the fly in games with beautiful graphics and animations.<br />
<br />
2 <a href=""https://www.coolmathgames.com/"" target=""_blank""><strong>Cool Math Games</strong></a><br />
<br />
This site does not feel like math is involved at all, and that might be its biggest strength. With games broken down by the sorts of thinking involved - <strong>strategy, skill, numbers, logic, and trivia,</strong> for example - almost all of the games feel like a ton of fun to play, hard to differentiate between an arcade.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.hoodamath.com/"" target=""_blank""><strong>HoodaMath</strong></a><br />
<br />
There are tons of unique titles on this site that provide <strong>children</strong> with something new that keeps them coming back for more.<br />
<br />
With titles such as &lsquo;goat crossing&rsquo; and &lsquo;papa&rsquo;s cheeseria,&rsquo; it&rsquo;s easy to see what <strong>HoodaMath</strong> is a favorite of many children. </span></p>

But in reality, it is just the reverse, as everyone, regardless of the size of the business, can use <a href=""https://www.candybar.co/blog/succeed-in-influencer-marketing/"" target=""_blank"">influencer marketing</a> and work in coordination with influencer marketers. There are many media companies who have a pool of influencers to promote their clients&#39; products for them.<br />
<br />
2020 is the year of <a href=""https://www.impactbnd.com/blog/power-of-micro-influencers"" target=""_blank""><strong>micro-influencers</strong></a>, and you must look for the creators that have less than 1 million followers. But, ensure to collaborate with the micro-influencers that align with your brand values and image for better results. </span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>Master the Social Media Algorithms </strong><br />
<br />
It is important to befriend <a href=""https://digitalmarketinginstitute.com/blog/how-do-social-media-algorithms-work"" target=""_blank""><strong>social media algorithms</strong></a> to become successful virtually on social media channels. Many reports suggest that organic reach is declining, but this doesn&rsquo;t mean that you should give up. You must focus on understanding the types of <strong>content</strong> preferred by every platform and use it within your strategy to heighten the organic reach.<br />
<br />
The key aspect here is <strong>creativity</strong> and <strong>engagement</strong>. So, be creative and create some engaging content in adherence to algorithm updates to optimize the organic results. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>Be Private </strong><br />
<br />
Social Media is the platform where we usually socialize, but the biggest social media goal for 2020 must be <strong>privacy</strong>. Because of data exposure, issues with political polarization, and high profile sacking people are now closing their social media profiles and gradually switching to more private and intimate conversations virtually.<br />
<br />
People are using social channels and apps, but the conversations of users have moved out of the public eye, which is a crucial trend for social media marketers to note.<br />
<br />
Brands can now cater to this trend only by instigating <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups/"" target=""_blank""><strong>Facebook Group</strong></a> or create a &ldquo;Close Friends&rdquo; list for top fans on Instagram. With such options, brands can easily share exclusive content with loyal followers, which will encourage them to interact further with the account holders for the sake of getting the invite. </span></p>

Acquire the reputation of a respectable and professional private tutor and grow your client base. ","tutors,private tutors,home tutor mistake","Top_5_Mistakes_That_All_Tutors_Should_Avoid.jpg","<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">Every parent in the world strives to provide the best opportunities to their children. And one of the ways they can do that is by <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/blog/6-reasons-why-tuition-is-necessary-in-singapore"" target=""_blank""><strong>hiring private tutors to enhance their children&rsquo;s knowledge</strong></a>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Private tuition</strong> sets up their child for future success and for that reason tutors have an enormous responsibility to deliver the goods they have promised.<br />
<br />
<em>Today home tutors in Singapore operate in an extremely competitive environment where one bad review can either <strong>make or break a tutoring career</strong>. </em><br />
<br />
In order to earn a stellar reputation as a private tutor avoid making <strong>5 mistakes</strong> listed below.<br />
<br />
Eradicating those errors from your daily practice will help you <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/register-as-tutor"" onclick=""window.open(this.href, '', 'resizable=no,status=no,location=no,toolbar=no,menubar=no,fullscreen=no,scrollbars=no,dependent=no'); return false;""><strong>grow your private tuition business</strong></a> and stand out from the competition. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>1. No Ground Rules </strong><br />
<br />
Set clear ground rules from the very beginning and <strong>stick</strong> by them.&nbsp;</span><span style=""font-size:18px"">This applies to both parents and students.<br />
<br />
Tutors often make a mistake of trying too hard to be likeable and in pursuit of this they become excessively <strong>flexible</strong>. Of course, it is important to be polite however it is also important to establish some ground rules before home tutoring sessions have even started.<br />
<br />
For example, you should discuss with the parents what are your policies regarding the <strong>cancellation</strong> of one or more lessons and lateness. Make sure to communicate your policies clearly to the parent and adhere to them throughout the entire course.<br />
<br />
Such <strong>consistency</strong> will help you avoid wasting your time and losing potential revenue. As for children, home tutors should definitely try and formulate a different set of rules for them as well.<br />
<br />
Make sure to explain to the child that there is a <strong>set of objectives</strong> which have to be met during each lesson. In an attempt to establish a friendly relationship with the child some tutors allow the children to set the terms of the lesson.<br />
<br />
Although it is important to appear friendly, the child must understand that he will have to <strong>follow your lead</strong> during the lesson not vice versa. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>2. Unrealistic goals</strong><br />
<br />
Home tuition, as I have already mentioned, is a rather competitive field, so sometimes in order to attract new clients private tutors set <strong>unrealistic</strong> expectations.<br />
<br />
All parents want their children to acquire knowledge as soon as possible, so some of them may be tempted to opt for the tutor who promises them the moon and the stars in a period of mere months.<br />
<br />
<span style=""color:#e74c3c""><em><strong>Remember, telling parents what they want to hear may fool some, but it is never a good long-term strategy</strong></em>.</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">Over-promising and under-delivering things as well as setting unrealistic deadlines is a recipe for disappointment. It might cause you to lose your existing clientele rather quickly and bad word of mouth and negative reviews may also deter any potential clients which will harm your career in the long term. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>3. Lack of a Lesson Plan</strong><br />
<br />
Creating a <strong>custom lesson plan</strong> in advance is always a good idea. In a private tuition setting you are the one who is responsible for setting educational goals. <u>For that reason having a lesson plan is a must.</u><br />
<br />
It is always a good idea to <strong>divide the allotted time</strong> into easily manageable segments. Each part of the lesson can be devoted to a different activity.<br />
<br />
Make sure to choose in advance the sources (e.g. books, articles) that are relevant to your <strong>educational objectives</strong>. Failure to do so will result in an erratic lesson and will make you appear less professional in the eyes of the parent.<br />
<br />
Also it will be good if you communicate your short-term objectives to the child before the beginning of each lesson. If you are working with small children they might require a <strong>5-minute break in the middle of the lesson</strong> to recharge their batteries. These must also be discussed in advance.<br />
<br />
Outlining a clear path will not only make you appear more professional but it will also make the child more co-operative and compliant. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>4. Don&#39;t be a lecturer - Be a mentor. </strong><br />
<br />
Some private tutors spend most of their lesson <strong>endlessly talking</strong> to their students explain complex notions in excruciating detail while their glassy-eyed pupils daydream about video games.<br />
<br />
Remember what differentiates <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/search-tutors"" target=""_blank""><strong>good home tutors</strong></a> from bad ones is not their ability to talk for hours on end but whether their students retain the information provided to them by their private tutors.<br />
<br />
So turn your lessons into a <strong>fun collaborative activity</strong> and if your lesson does call for a lengthy monologue, make sure to intersperse it with questions addressed at your student to make sure that he or she is following the point you are trying to make. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>5. Boring your students out. Make the lesson fun! </strong><br />
<br />
<em>&ldquo;All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.&rdquo;</em><br />
<br />
Experts say that the current generation is the most tested generation in the history of the world.<br />
<br />
Children today are under enormous <strong>pressure</strong> both from their parents and the society to be the best and the most studious versions of themselves.<br />
<br />
Last thing they want from their private tuition is more of the same tedious teaching experience. It will be a good idea if you include some <strong>game-based tasks</strong> in your lessons that are not only educational but also entertaining.<br />
<br />
There is a large number of<a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/blog/self-guided-learning-best-3-e-learning-resources"" target=""_blank""> <strong>online tools and elearning applications</strong> </a>that have successfully combined education and fun. Utilising these resources during your lessons will make your students more motivated.<br />
<br />
Devoting 5 minutes at the end of the lesson to these fun activities will help to foster students&#39; <strong>positive attitude </strong>towards the class you teach.<br />
<br />
Such activities, strategically placed at the end of the lesson, can also be used as a bargaining chip to <strong>motivate</strong> the student to successfully complete all of the previous tasks. </span></p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><strong>...</strong></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">Of course this is not an exhaustive list of all the things <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/request-tutor"" target=""_blank""><strong>home tutors</strong></a> need to do to hone their skills to perfection.<br />
<br />
However by being consistent in following these essential and simple rules you will be able to <strong>differentiate</strong> yourself from other home tutors in Singapore, acquire the reputation of a respectable and professional private tutor and grow your client base.</span></p>","1","2020-06-20","2020-06-20 17:53:33"

Here are 10 Hard Truths About JC life all students should know.","jc,junior college,jc life,jc difficult,jc hard","10_Hard_Truths_About_JC_life_You_Need_To_Know.jpg","<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">The reason vast majority of students choose to attend junior college is that it is the path that will lead you straight to <strong>university</strong>.<br />
<br />
You have already passed your <a href=""https://www.seab.gov.sg/home/examinations/gce-o-level"" target=""_blank""><strong>O level exams</strong></a> and are feeling pretty confident that if you study hard for 2 more years you&rsquo;ll pass your A levels and will be admitted to the university of your dreams.<br />
<br />
Sounds pretty straightforward right? <em>Well, think again.</em><br />
<br />
Life of a JC student may not be as rosy as it first appears. A lot of former <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junior_college"" target=""_blank""><strong>junior college</strong></a> students describe this period of their lives as stressful and disheartening, and some even go so far as to call it the hell on Earth.<br />
<br />
<em><strong>So, what exactly makes the life of a Junior College student so hard? </strong></em><br />
<br />
Here are 10 hard truths you need to be aware of to prepare yourself for the JC life. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>1. JC requires a lot of self-study. </strong><br />
<br />
You have probably got used to the secondary school teachers <strong>spoon-feeding</strong> you the information and you might think that&rsquo;s the way it is at junior colleges as well, right? Wrong!<br />
<br />
Junior colleges will test your ability to self-motivate and <a href=""https://blog.rescuetime.com/time-management-for-students/"" target=""_blank""><strong>manage your time</strong></a>.<br />
<br />
Did any <strong>misconceptions</strong> arise during the lectures?<br />
<br />
Do you have any <strong>doubts</strong> regarding the information you have just received?<br />
<br />
Well, tough luck. It is now your responsibility to sort it all out.<br />
<br />
Do yourself a favour and do it as soon as possible. Because if you don&#39;t, the work will soon <strong>snowball</strong> and you will find yourself gasping for air under a huge pile of unfinished essays. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>2. Project Work is the stuff of nightmares. </strong><br />
<br />
I mean, it is hard enough for JC students to come up with innovative solutions for <a href=""https://www.cambridgeinternational.org/news/news-details/view/students-want-to-learn-about-global-issues-in-school-yet-one-in-three-dont-20200302/"" target=""_blank""><strong>global issues</strong></a> that are plaguing our society nowadays, but doing that with a bunch of people you have only known for less than 5 minutes, and who are, on top of that, uncooperative has to be just the type of situation that makes up one of the circles of Hell.<br />
<br />
It will make you realise the person who came up with an expression &ldquo;two heads are better than one&rdquo; definitely has not studied at junior college and taken <a href=""https://www.seab.gov.sg/docs/default-source/national-examinations/syllabus/alevel/2020syllabus/8808_y20_sy.pdf"" target=""_blank""><strong>Project Work</strong></a> before. </span></p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><span style=""font-size:18px""><img alt=""Project work"" src=""https://tutorcity.sg/admin_tutor/attachments/uploads/Project_Work_A-levels.png"" style=""height:250px; width:380px"" /></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>3. Roses are red, violets are blue, and rich kids have it easier than you. </strong><br />
<br />
We all know that in life in general wealthy people have access to better resources so it shouldn&#39;t come as a surprise that colleges are not an <strong>exception</strong> to this rule.<br />
<br />
While you are spending hours furiously taking down notes and organising your data, Richie Riches of the world can summon one of their <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/jc-tuition"" target=""_blank""><strong>private tutors</strong></a> and have them compress the entire course curriculum into a few comprehensive cheat sheets.<br />
<br />
That doesn&#39;t mean that students with fewer financial resources don&#39;t stand a chance, but they definitely do have to walk up a much steeper hill. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>4. Co-curricular activities are yet another source of headache.</strong><br />
<br />
Participating in your favourite <strong>sport</strong> or playing your favourite <strong>instrument</strong> in a band after a hard day&#39;s studying may seem like a good idea on paper, but in reality it is yet another activity that makes your anxiety go through the roof.<br />
<br />
And many students who join <strong>CCAs</strong> do it just for the sake of their portfolio, so don&rsquo;t expect everybody in the drama club to be as enthusiastic about the early works of Shakespeare as you are. </span></p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><span style=""font-size:18px""><img alt=""CCAs"" src=""https://tutorcity.sg/admin_tutor/attachments/uploads/CCAs.png"" style=""border-style:solid; border-width:1px; height:250px; width:380px"" /></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>5. Watch your back! </strong><br />
<br />
One junior college student has her notes <strong>stolen</strong>.<br />
<br />
Another one discovers that her stationary items have been <strong>destroyed</strong> with merely hours leading up to an exam.<br />
<br />
No, these are not scenes from teenage horror films, these are real-life situations some JC students had to <strong>endure</strong>.<br />
<br />
So if you plan on making out of JC with your mental health intact it&#39;s a good idea to have eyes in the back of your head. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>6. Student, meet failure. </strong><br />
<br />
So, you where a star student in your secondary school, and now you&rsquo;re stepping into JC thinking that it will be a piece of cake.<br />
<br />
Well I&#39;m about to burst your bubble. Junior college is more like a piece of stale fruit cake. <strong>Hard and tough</strong> to swallow.<br />
<br />
So if you get a bunch of Cs on your report card <strong>don&rsquo;t get discouraged</strong>. I assure you, you are not the only one. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>7. There aren&#39;t enough hours in a day. </strong><br />
<br />
Commute to school, attended the lectures, participate in CCAs, commute home, join tuition centres or <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/request-tutor"" target=""_blank""><strong>private tuition</strong></a>, do your homework,&nbsp;go to sleep.<br />
<br />
Wake up. Repeat.<br />
<br />
<strong><em>Social life? HA! Forget it! </em></strong><br />
<br />
You are a JC student now. Friends, boyfriends and girlfriends can wait until after the A Levels. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>8. Integrated program students will always be ahead of you.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong><a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/ip-tuition"" target=""_blank"">IP students</a></strong> bypass the O level exams and go straight to A level preparations.<br />
<br />
Because of this O level graduates are in a disadvantageous position when it comes to getting used to how the system functions. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>9. What about the soft skills? </strong><br />
<br />
During the 2 years at JC students get used to a very <strong>structured</strong> system.<br />
<br />
Your life revolves around your aspiration to achieve academic excellence but what about the <a href=""https://www.wikihow.com/Improve-Soft-Skills"" target=""_blank""><strong>soft skills </strong></a>a.k.a. the common sense every human being needs to navigate the real world?<br />
<br />
Well, JC teaches you maths, science, history etc. but if you want to know how to be a <strong>leader</strong> or a <strong>critical</strong> <strong>thinker</strong> the onus is on you to figure that one out. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>10. Stationery shops will drain your pockets.</strong><br />
<br />
Pencils, erasers, pens, notebooks, rulers will not break the bank individually, however when you have to buy them in large quantities throughout the entire term the cost adds up. </span></p>

<p style=""text-align:center""><strong>...</strong></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px"">To conclude JC life definitely isn&#39;t a walk in the park, but it is a <strong>stepping</strong> <strong>stone</strong> towards your final goal. The obstacle that stands between you and your career as a doctor, lawyer scientist etc.<br />
<br />
So keep your eye on the ball, and if you start feeling overwhelmed buy yourself a &ldquo;Hang in there&rdquo; kitten poster for your bedroom wall.<br />
<br />
And remember, thousands of students have already survived this experience there is no reason why you shouldn&#39;t. If all else fails, perhaps an experienced <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/jc-tuition"" target=""_blank""><strong>JC tutor</strong></a> can help you ease your burden.</span></p>","1","2020-06-22","2020-06-22 16:59:14"

<br />
<span style=""background-color:white"">Parents and Students in&nbsp;Singapore are perhaps more familiar with the O-level exams rather than IGCSE.<br />
<br />
In general, one could say that <strong>more similarities than differences</strong> can be found if we go through these curricula with a fine-tooth comb and they may even be regarded as interchangeable as both of them serve the same purpose.<br />
<br />
In addition, both of them are recognized by the majority of the best universities around the world and passing either of them constitutes a stepping stone towards one&rsquo;s A-level exams and subsequent university admission.<br />
<br />
Both exams <strong>occur twice a year</strong> and are designed for 14 to16 year-olds.<br />
<br />
So, it can be safely assumed that no matter which one a child ends up taking, if they pass with flying colors they will be one giant step closer to a brighter future.<br />
<br />
However, although both IGCSE and O-levels essentially serve the same purpose and are taken by the students in the same age group, there are still <strong>some notable differences</strong> between them you should definitely be aware of. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><strong><span style=""background-color:white"">1. Grading system differs slightly.</span></strong></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><span style=""background-color:white"">In both cases students are graded by using internationally recognizable alphabetical characters.<br />
<br />
However, there is a slight difference in the range of characters used in the grading process.<br />
<br />
IGCSE grades range from <strong>A (being the highest grade a candidate can achieve) to G (being the lowest)</strong>.<br />
<br />
In case of sitting the O-level exams students can achieve grades <strong>A1 (the highest) to F9 (the lowest)</strong>. </span></span></span><br />

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">Another, and perhaps the most noteworthy difference is that O-level exam candidates are offered the same exam paper regardless of their academic capability, whereas the IGCSE examiners take into account different capabilities of the students and in some subjects present them with two options in the form of <a href=""https://help.cambridgeinternational.org/hc/en-gb/articles/203494082-What-is-the-difference-between-IGCSE-Core-and-Extended-"" style=""color:blue; text-decoration:underline"">IGCSE Core and Extended paper.</a><br />
<br />
The <strong>core curriculum</strong> paper is within the ability of vast majority of students and is given to students who are expected to achieve a grade between C and G.<br />
<br />
<strong>Extended curriculum </strong>(which consists of the core curriculum and the Supplement) has been designed for those students who are believed to be more academically gifted and are expected to achieve a grade between A and E.</span></span></p>

As for the O-level curriculum, it can also be adjusted to consist of only those subjects that educational institutions deem appropriate. However, unlike IGCSE the Cambridge O-level curriculum is comprised merely of <strong>40 plus subjects.</strong><br />
<br />
On the other hand, according to the official <a href=""https://www.cambridgeinternational.org/"" style=""color:blue; text-decoration:underline"">Cambridgeinternational.org</a> page both IGCSE and O-levels improve teenagers&rsquo; ability to gain understanding of the subject content, enable them to apply their knowledge to both familiar and unfamiliar situations, make them more flexible and responsive to change, as well as increase their cultural awareness.</span></span><br />

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><strong>4. Managed by international and local authorities. </strong></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">Another difference is that O-levels are more <strong>decentralized</strong>. Singapore-Cambridge General Certificate of Education Ordinary Level exam was held for the first time in Singapore in 1971.<br />
<br />
In 2006 it was delinked from the O-level exams in the United Kingdom. This was due to the desire of the <a href=""https://www.moe.gov.sg/"" style=""color:blue; text-decoration:underline"">Ministry of Education</a> to introduce greater flexibility into the curriculum and gain greater control over how the examination process was managed.<br />
<br />
One of the ways MOE did that was by allowing educational institutions to offer OSIE (O-level School Initiated Electives) in order to fill the gap in the niche areas.<br />
<br />
Today three official bodies, The Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board, Ministry of Education and the Cambridge Assessment International Education, jointly preside over the exam in Singapore.<br />
<br />
As for the IGCSE syllabuses they retain a <strong>more international outlook</strong> and schools from all around the world are involved in the development of the curriculum and the final exam. They are specially designed to avoid cultural biases in an international setting. </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><strong>5. There is a minor difference in the end of course assessment. </strong></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">Both IGCSE and O-level assessments take place at the end of the course and consist of several components. <a href=""https://www.seab.gov.sg/home/examinations/e-exam-resources"" style=""color:blue; text-decoration:underline"">O-levels include</a> written, oral as well as practical exams.<br />
<br />
Similarly to the O-levels <a href=""https://www.cambridgeinternational.org/programmes-and-qualifications/cambridge-upper-secondary/cambridge-igcse/qualification/"" style=""color:blue; text-decoration:underline"">IGCSE assessment</a> also includes written, oral and practical exams however it may also include coursework assessment.<br />
<br />
The addition of <strong>coursework</strong> <strong>assessment</strong> is especially beneficial for those students whose first language is not English as it gives them the opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge and accumulate high grades throughout the duration of the course not just at the end of it.<br />
<br />
This assessment structure, combined with the IGCSE&rsquo;s wider range of grades as well as the aforementioned <strong>Core and Extended</strong> papers perhaps gives the candidates a slightly better chance at passing these exams.</span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:center""><strong>...</strong></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">A few words must be said about the <strong>teaching materials</strong> as well. In general materials and coursebooks used in both curricula are of the same difficulty level.<br />
<br />
<strong><em>It cannot be said that one curriculum/exam is significantly easier or harder than the other</em></strong>.<br />
<br />
Moreover, there have been instances of certain teachers using the same coursebook to give instruction in both IGCSE and O-levels.<br />
<br />
Cambridge international assessment center even provides teaching materials, school support and professional development for the teaching staff in order to maintain a high standard of education in case of both courses. </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">Although, it should be noted that although both IGCSE and O-level examinations are extremely <strong>popular</strong> all over the world, due to the characteristics listed above (wider grade range, Core and Extended exam papers, coursework assessment etc.) IGSCE enjoys bigger popularity in the<strong> international setting</strong>.<br />
<br />
But, as it has been written already, no matter which exam you take successfully passing it will undoubtedly form the foundation of your future success.</span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">History is not a subject you can study in a day. Make sure it&rsquo;s part of your <a href=""https://www.daniel-wong.com/the-perfect-study-plan/"" style=""color:blue; text-decoration:underline"">weekly study plan</a> and you have enough time for revisions before your exam.<br />
<br />
Familiarize yourself with the syllabus and break it down into sections to incorporate it into your <strong>study</strong> <strong>plan</strong>. Make the sections in such a way that it helps you get the bigger picture and are in chronological order.<br />
<br />
You will just be confusing yourself if you don&rsquo;t follow a <strong>sequence</strong> when you are studying the subject for the first time.<br />
<br />
You can <strong>prioritize</strong> the topics and concentrate on the ones you found difficult to understand when you start your revisions. </span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm"">&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Cambria,serif""><span style=""color:#4f81bd""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">2. Weave a Story</span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">History is nothing but a story of different <strong>life-changing events</strong>. As you read different topics, try and connect the dots so that you can relate to the events, and have a clear story in your mind.<br />
<br />
There is a high chance that your grandparents or a relative might have been eye-witnesses to some of the <strong>events</strong> mentioned in your syllabus.<br />
<br />
Discussing history with them might be a good way to get to know more on the topic and you might even get to know some of their personal experiences during that period. The personal touch would help you remember and weave the story better.</span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Cambria,serif""><span style=""color:#4f81bd""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">3. Graphical Representation</span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">History is all about facts. Remembering the names of people, movements, and dates are so important to ace the subject.<br />
<br />
To help you remember all these facts it&rsquo;s advised to make a table or chart with all the important events in chronological order.<br />
<br />
Graphical representation really helps in retaining and recalling what you have studied.<br />
<br />
You can use <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/blog/self-guided-learning-best-3-e-learning-resources"" style=""color:blue; text-decoration:underline"">online tools and apps to make learning resources</a> like flashcards, quizzes, mind maps, and online notes.

<br />
You should also know the <strong>weightage</strong> given to each topic in terms of the number of questions and marks so that you can concentrate more on them.<br />

Leveraging different <strong>edutainment</strong> resources would make the learning experience fun too. You can watch movies, documentaries, podcasts, and online courses available on platforms like YouTube, Netflix, <a href=""https://www.udemy.com/"" style=""color:blue; text-decoration:underline"">Udemy</a>, Harvard University, and <a href=""https://www.coursera.org/"" style=""color:blue; text-decoration:underline"">Coursera</a>.<br />

<br />
Fortunately, the <strong>phonics method</strong> provides a relatively easy way for a child to master the complexity of the English sound system.<br />
<br />
The effectiveness of the method is attested my millions of <strong>teachers</strong> who use this method in their classrooms on a daily basis.<br />
<br />
However, even if you are not an <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/search-tutors"" style=""color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline"">English teacher</a>, but just a caring parent who wants to help their children take their first steps towards mastering the English language, these methods are still the best routes to success. </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><strong>1. Keep it short and sweet.</strong></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">Children have a short attention span, so having an hour-long study session several times a week will be rather unproductive. Instead plan a short <strong>15-minute lesson</strong> which you can conduct every day.<br />
<br />
Think of studying a foreign language as you do of eating food: it is better to have smaller, balanced meals every day rather than eating big piles of food three times a week.<br />
<br />
And make sure to pick the time of your lesson wisely. If a child is too tired then studying, no matter how brief, will only make them irritated. </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><strong>2. One step at a time.</strong></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">In the initial stages it is best if you devote each of your 15-minute lessons to several (three or four) phonic sounds at a time. In the long term it is better for a child to memorize three phonic sounds well, rather than fumble with eight. </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><strong>3. Buy alphabet cards (or make them yourself).</strong></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">There are a lot of <strong>flash cards</strong> on the market designed specifically for the purpose of teaching phonics. They may include colorful and relevant pictures which will make the job at hand even easier.<br />
<br />
If you can&rsquo;t find such cards in your <a href=""https://www.popular.com.sg/"" style=""color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline"">local bookshop</a> fear not!<br />
<br />
Just take a stack of old playing cards, glue them down in several rows on sheets of paper (both plain white or colored paper will do) cut them out and write the letters on the cards. Voila! You have <strong>phonics</strong> flash cards!<br />
<br />
If that is a tall order as well then simple sheets of paper cut into fairly even rectangles will do the trick.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><strong>4. Colorful letters are easier to memorize.</strong></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">It is believed that reading something written in an unusual font with colorful letters helps children memorize whatever has been written better.<br />
<br />
So, if you do end up making your own <a href=""https://www.pupsikstudio.com/usborne-phonics-flashcards.html"" style=""color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline"">phonics cards</a> make sure to use a vast array of colorful markers and whimsical letters. </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><strong>5. Games make studying child&rsquo;s play.</strong></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">It is important that a child has fun while learning phonics.<br />
<br />
If they start associating the lessons with the sense of boredom they will lose their motivation which will hinder their progress. Phonics games help your child learn without losing an ounce of the drive.<br />
<br />
If you want to incorporate <a href=""https://readingeggs.co.uk/articles/2016/01/25/phonics-games/"" style=""color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline"">games</a> into your study routine the internet is your best friend.<br />
<br />
There are many useful websites filled to the brim with <a href=""https://www.phonicsbloom.com/"" style=""color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline"">phonics games</a> a mere click of the button away.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><strong>6. Sing the phonics songs.</strong></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">Another great way to make sure your study session brings maximum results is listening to <strong>phonics songs</strong>. Phonic sounds set to a tune are much easier to memorize.<br />
<br />
There are thousands of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=phonic+sounds"" style=""color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline"">phonic sounds and songs in YouTube</a>. So, even if you are unable to conduct a lesson one day because you are busy or feel exhausted worry not!<br />
<br />
Just go to a reputable children&rsquo;s channel, pull up one of their phonics videos and let the fun educational experience commence.<br />
<br />
This way your child still gets their recommended daily dose of phonics while you catch a much-earned break.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><strong>7. C-V-C words and minimal pairs.</strong></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">C-V-C words are simple <strong>three letter words</strong> that follow a consonant/vowel/consonant pattern (e.g. cat, hat, dad etc.)<br />
<br />
Minimal pair is a pair of simple words that only <strong>differs</strong> by one letter (e.g. pen/hen, run/rug, bag/big etc.)<br />
<br />
These words are essential for those who want to <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/english-tuition"" style=""color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline"">learn how to read in English</a>.<br />
<br />
They are a perfect learning tool for small children, as they illustrate how the <strong>difference in one single letter/phonic</strong> sound can cause the change in meaning.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><strong>8. Read aloud, don&rsquo;t be shy.</strong></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">Make sure your child pronounces the sounds as clearly as possible.<br />
<br />
Many children feel shy to pronounce unfamiliar sounds so make sure to practice positive reinforcement and praise them every time they manage to complete the task successfully.<br />
<br />
After they have advanced a bit in their studies and are able to read full sentences you can choose from a vast variety of <a href=""https://letterland.com.sg/about-us/"" style=""color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline"">children&rsquo;s books</a> available for purchase online.<br />
<br />
Many of these books have been written specifically with the <a href=""https://www.jollylearning.co.uk/"" style=""color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline"">phonics teaching method</a> in mind and will undoubtedly be beneficial for the development of your child&rsquo;s literacy skills.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><strong>9. Repetition is the mother of all learning.</strong></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">Repeating old material will not only reinforce your child&rsquo;s knowledge but also boost their self-esteem.<br />
<br />
It is impossible to remember everything on the first go, so <strong>never get annoyed</strong> with the child if they don&rsquo;t remember some of the old material.<br />
<br />
Instead praise them for the things they do remember and go over the forgotten points again. If they have a particular <a href=""https://singapore.kinokuniya.com/t/books/english-books/childrens-books"" style=""color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline"">children&rsquo;s book</a> they enjoy, read it to them again and again.<br />
<br />
After some time they may even be able to memorize the entire plot of the book by heart in which case you can encourage them to read the book by themselves (but make sure to monitor them the first time to make sure they are doing it correctly)</span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">Children have many different innate talents. Some have a stellar photographic memory, so they may find it easier to learn from the flash cards.<br />
<br />
Some have a <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/music-lessons"" style=""color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline"">musical talent</a> and benefit far more from a jolly singalong.

<br />
Both of these enable the students to qualify for <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/a-level-tuition"" target=""_blank"">A-level (GCE Advanced level) exams</a>.<br />
<br />
O-levels are well-known among the secondary school students as they have existed for many years.<br />
<br />
On the other hand the IP is a more <strong>recent</strong> phenomenon and only those students that are top of their class are eligible for it.<br />
<br />
Once your child successfully finishes primary school you can enroll them into the Integrated Programme which is a <strong>straightforward</strong> path towards A-level exams.<br />
<br />
<strong><em>However one must keep in mind that the IP is not suitable for everyone.</em></strong><br />
<br />
The choice you make between enrolling your child into IP or letting them take the path that leads to O-levels may have a monumental impact on their <strong>future success</strong>.</span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><strong><span style=""background-color:white"">1. So what exactly is the difference between the IP and O-levels?</span></strong></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><span style=""background-color:white"">The <a href=""http://www.moe.gov.sg/microsites/whats-next/for-psle-students/where-do-i-want-to-go/integrated-programme-ip/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Integrated Programme </a>was first introduced by the <a href=""http://www.moe.gov.sg/"" target=""_blank"">Ministry of Education</a>&nbsp;in 2004 and is offered by selected schools in Singapore that aim to provide secondary education at the highest level.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><span style=""background-color:white"">The programme lasts for 6 years and, as it has already been mentioned, it allows gifted students to <strong>avoid O-levels</strong> and have a go at the International Baccalaureate or A-level exams directly.<br />
<br />
The programme is targeted at around <strong>top 10 %</strong> of those students that take PSLE exams. </span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><span style=""background-color:white"">The IP curriculum is <strong>broader and more flexible</strong> than that of the O-levels and it enables the students to develop various skills and talents as well as satisfy their intellectual curiosity.<br />
<br />
Unlike the IP curriculum the O-level curriculum takes 4 or 5 years to complete (the Express Stream and the Normal Academic Stream respectively). </span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><span style=""background-color:white"">If we had to highlight the main difference between these two it would be the fact that the IP enables the students to <strong>skip the O-level exams </strong>and take the exams that will enable them to gain entry to university straightaway.<br />
<br />
It is not hard to see how that may be beneficial for students. <strong>One less exam means less stress and more time</strong> to devote to the preparation for the exam that matters the most: the exam that will grant you access to your dream university.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><strong><span style=""background-color:white"">2. How exactly does the IP benefit secondary school students?</span></strong></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><span style=""background-color:white"">The time students save by not worrying about passing their O-levels they can devote to expanding their knowledge in both academic and non-academic ways. The IP students are usually <strong>academically</strong> <strong>ahead</strong> of their peers.<br />
<br />
They enhance their logical skills by discussing more complex topics, and in general gain more knowledge by studying <a href=""https://www.moe.gov.sg/microsites/whats-next/for-psle-students/where-do-i-want-to-go/integrated-programme-ip/index.html"" target=""_blank"">higher-level subjects</a><strong>.</strong><br />
<br />
And since the IP students don&rsquo;t have to cram for O-level exams they have more time left over to get involved in enrichment programmes and <strong>develop essential soft skills</strong> (such as critical thinking, communication skills, problem solving skills etc.) which will help them become highly-functioning members of society.<br />
<br />
One more thing IP students can do with their extra time is get involved in the extracurricular activities and programmes that benefit the local community.<br />
<br />
Such activities help students develop vital personal characteristics (e.g. sense of responsibility and empathy). Other <strong>extracurricular</strong> activities a child might get involved in include sports and arts, which will make their school years not only educational but also very enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Nowadays children are under immense pressure to achieve <strong>academic</strong> success which may lead to high levels of anxiety among teens. Having those brief moments of being immersed in their favorite activity will provide a welcome respite. </span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><strong><span style=""background-color:white"">3. Who is suitable for the IP?</span></strong></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><span style=""background-color:white"">As it has been written above only <a href=""https://www.asiaone.com/singapore/top-secondary-schools-singapore-2019-based-psle-cop-2018"" target=""_blank"">top 10 % of those students</a> who have passed their PSLE exams are accepted into the IP. So the first stage of the selection process is present in the form of <strong>academic scores.</strong><br />
<br />
Not being in the top 10 % indicates that a student is not ready to handle the complexity of the IP curriculum. However, even if your child qualifies from the academic point of view you might still want to <strong>think long and hard</strong> before deciding to enroll them into the IP.<br />
<br />
Knowing your child&rsquo;s study habits is crucial before deciding to enroll them into the programme as he/she will only succeed if they make an effort and commit fully to the <strong>complex</strong> IP curriculum.<br />
<br />
Adapting to the style of learning is as important as getting the hang of the <strong>pace of learning</strong>. Otherwise the student may find that they struggle to cope and leave the programme before they complete it.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><span style=""background-color:white"">This is an appropriate programme for those children who have a <strong>high degree of self-discipline</strong> and can be trusted to perform their duties diligently, and in addition possess the ability to adapt swiftly to new circumstances.<br />
<br />
If your child doesn&rsquo;t have what it takes to handle the rigorous IP curriculum, enrolling them in the O-level programme is a better option.<br />
<br />
What&rsquo;s more some schools provide both programmes and allow students to <strong>switch from one to the other</strong>. </span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><span style=""background-color:white""><strong>To conclude</strong>, successfully completing both IP and O-levels will enable your child to take A-level exams which in turn will grant them access to university.<br />
<br />
Although the IP is much more selective in the enrollment process not all students can keep up with the complexities of the curriculum and O-level route still is a very popular choice for secondary school students.</span></span></span></p>","1","2020-06-30","2020-06-30 15:21:25"

<br />

It tells us that your answer must contain the <strong>analysis</strong> of tropes and other methods writers utilized in their works in order to reveal a certain phenomenon.<br />
<br />
The term &ldquo;<strong>different writers</strong>&rdquo; call for a comparison between two or more writers, and &ldquo;modern&rdquo; reveals that the examiners are only interested in how the X is revealed in the context of contemporary world.<br />

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><span style=""background-color:white"">In order to achieve high marks you need to show that you have a <strong>deeper understanding</strong> of the texts you have read. Merely laying out the plot will not do.<br />
<br />
You have to demonstrate that you caught on to the main <strong>themes</strong> of the text, understood the writer&rsquo;s concerns and identified the effect he wanted to create.<br />
<br />
On the one hand, the beauty of the <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/blog/rhythm-and-rhyme-in-english-poetry"" target=""_blank"">literary text</a> consists in the fact that everyone may have their own opinion on what the writer had meant.<br />
<br />
However if the written work in question was extensively discussed during the course then it is perhaps wiser to stick to the <strong>interpretation</strong> which was agreed upon in the class.</span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><strong>5. Support what you have written with textual evidence</strong><strong>.</strong></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">If you think that you can just write your opinion down and call it a day you are mistaken. It is essential that you <strong>support your point with the evidence</strong> that is present in the text.<br />
<br />
However, try not to devote too much space to writing down the quotes from the author. Simply copy-pasting author&rsquo;s words from memory onto your exam paper will <u><strong>not</strong></u> do you any good.<br />
<br />
It is much better if their words are interwoven with your ideas serve to prove your opinions.</span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">That&#39;s another one of those points that may seem obvious but still needs reminding.<br />
<br />
Examiners cannot give you full marks if they don&#39;t understand what you&#39;re trying to say. So first of all make sure that your point is as <strong>clear</strong> as a bell.<br />
<br />
In addition, organise your writing into neat <strong>paragraphs</strong> and make sure that sentences are linked to one another in a coherent manner.<br />
<br />
These <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/english-tuition"" target=""_blank"">essay-writing tips</a> are rather basic, but that is precisely the reason why they are considered essential.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><strong>7. Comment on the way specific writers </strong><strong>use </strong><strong>the language to express their ideas. </strong></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">That is yet another thing you must be able to do if you have high hopes of achieving a high band score.<br />
<br />
You must be able to not only comment on the content of the text but also on the <strong>style</strong> in which the writer chose to present it. So knowing words such as <a href=""https://www.grammarly.com/blog/metaphor/"" target=""_blank"">metaphor</a>, simile and <a href=""https://examples.yourdictionary.com/examples-of-metonymy.html"" target=""_blank"">metonymy</a> etc. is most definitely a good idea.<br />
<br />
You should be able to identify where the writer uses these and other <strong>literary</strong> device and for what purpose.<br />
<br />
What was he/she hoping to achieve by using this specific device? Did they succeed in their intention?<br />
<br />
Demonstrating your ability to do this will show the examiner that you are capable of <strong>objectively criticising</strong> <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/shelf/show/literature"" target=""_blank"">works of literature</a>.</span></span></p>

<br />
Before we actually dive into discussing our example of situational writing it would be wise to say in a few words about <a href=""https://sg.news.yahoo.com/5-tips-situational-writing-psle-english-025521868.html"" target=""_blank"">what exactly is situational writing</a> in how the marks are distributed.<br />
<br />
First of all, it needs to be said that situational writing is a component part of Paper 1 of the <a href=""http://www.seab.gov.sg/content/syllabus/PSLE/2017_PSLE_Subject_info/0001_2017.pdf"" target=""_blank"">PSLE English Language exam</a>.<br />
<br />
The paper consists of two parts: situational writing and continuous writing and together they take up 1-hour and 10 minutes. </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><strong>1. How much time should the child spend on situational writing task?</strong></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">So, the first question is how much time should be devoted to <strong>situational writing</strong>. There is no precise guideline that can answer this question.<br />
<br />
It is generally recommended that children devote no more than <strong>20 minutes</strong> to this component of Paper 1 as continuous writing is more complex and takes up more time.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><strong>2. How is the task marked?</strong></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">Now let&#39;s have a look at the marks and how they are split up for this <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/psle-tuition"" target=""_blank"">PSLE paper</a>.<br />
<br />
6 marks are given for content and the 9 marks are allocated for language so, in total, a child has the opportunity to earn <strong>15</strong> marks in this task.<br />
<br />
And with <strong>diligence</strong> and <strong>preparation</strong> it is very much possible to achieve that highest score.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><strong>3. More about the content and the language.</strong></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">Before a child even starts writing there are <strong>four</strong> key points they need to identify.<br />
<br />
And those points can be abbreviated as <strong>PACW</strong>. They stand for &ldquo;purpose&rdquo;, &ldquo;audience&rdquo;, &ldquo;context&rdquo; and &ldquo;writer&rdquo;.<br />
<br />
First the child needs to understand what is the <strong>purpose</strong> of the email, letter etc.<br />
<br />
<em><u>Why are you writing? To inform somebody about something?</u></em><br />
<br />
To invite a person to an event or to complain about an unpleasant experience? All those scenarios require different vocabulary and writing style.<br />
<br />
You should also pay attention to your intended <strong>audience</strong>.<br />
<br />
Who are you writing the letter/email to? Is it your close friend or your boss? What is the power distance between you and the person you are writing to? Are you close friends or strangers?<br />
<br />
Finding answers to all of these questions will enable the child to deal with the task more effectively.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;<strong>Context</strong>&rdquo; basically means: is it a formal letter or an informal one? The formality or informality of the letter will depend largely on the audience. </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">Last, but not least, the final letter &ldquo;W&rdquo; stands for &ldquo;<strong>writer</strong>&rdquo;.<br />
<br />
Sometimes the task demands to write to one of your imaginary friends as yourself, in other cases the identity of the writer is already fixed and the child has to <strong>pretend</strong> to be that somebody and write a letter in their name.<br />
<br />
It is important for a child to pay attention to the <strong>identity</strong> of the writer and to make sure there is no mix up as this will result in a lower grade.<br />
<br />
All of the aforementioned points cover content, and taking them into consideration will help you receive full 6 marks.<br />
<br />
The remaining 9 marks are allocated to <strong>language</strong>.<br />
<br />
A child has to make sure to follow the <strong>rules of punctuation and that the grammatical structures</strong> are correct.<br />
<br />
In addition to this it is a good idea to use specific words known as <strong>connectors</strong> that are used for connecting a sentence with another one. These words are for example: in addition, moreover, by contrast etc.</span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">So now let&rsquo;s have a look at how to actually deal with the given <strong>task</strong>.<br />
<br />
The first thing you need to do is to read it really carefully.<br />
<br />
And by that I don&#39;t just mean reading the text that is next to the pictures, but even reading the heading to make sure you don&#39;t miss anything.<br />
<br />
The next step is to <strong>study the task box</strong> really carefully and to identify your PACW in it.</span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">Let&#39;s assume that the task says: &ldquo;Imagine that you are John Smith president of the sports club. You want to invite a famous athlete to give a talk at your organisation. Write an email to your potential guest speaker and invite them to the event. You should refer to the dialogue on the previous page.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
As we can see the name of the author was already provided in the task it is John Smith so the child has to keep in mind that they are <strong>pretending</strong> to be John Smith when writing this task.<br />
<br />
The <strong>purpose</strong> of this email is to invite somebody to perform a specific action at a specific event ( give a talk at the sports club).<br />
<br />
The name of the athlete in question is not given in the task, but it may be given in the dialogue that a child should keep referring to while writing their <strong>response</strong>. And finally, is the imaginary athlete you are trying to invite a stranger to the author?<br />
<br />
If so, the style of this email should be rather <strong>formal</strong> and <strong>polite</strong> because you&#39;re addressing an unknown person. In addition to the task box a child may be presented with additional content points which they must include in their response.<br />
<br />
This information will be laid out in bullet points however the content points you need to provide must exceed the number of bullet points that are written down on the paper. Don&#39;t forget to be <strong>referring</strong> back to the <strong>stimulus</strong> and highlighting relevant information that you may use in your response.</span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Arial,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">A system is a changing entity that consists of smaller parts that work together to perform a task. There are many different kinds of systems, including biological, chemical, physical, social and economic systems. A system is composed of two components: its parts and its environment. The parts are what make up the system; the environment is all that surrounds or interacts with them (e.g., air surrounding a person).</span></span></span></p>

We use energy to power our lives and lifestyles. We can classify energy as either potential or kinetic. Potential energy is stored away to be used later. A wound-up spring, a loaded gun and some gasoline in a tank are all examples of potential energy. Kinetic energy is in constant motion and cannot be stored (e.g., the vibrations of atoms). The burning of diesel fuel and the constant motion of an atom are both examples of kinetic energy.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size:18px"">In recent years, the PSLE Science testing format has been relatively standardized, and features similar sections and layouts. In order, these are:</span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Arial,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">1. Booklet A</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Arial,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">Booklet A features approximately 56 marks (56% of your final score), and consists mainly of multiple choice questions that test your understanding of the subjects listed above. Students often finish this section with a substantial amount of time to spare - which is good, because the next section is often more difficult.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Arial,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">2. Booklet B</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Arial,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">Booklet B, on the other hand, is 44 marks, open-ended, and consists of a long-form question answer layout that tests your ability to both write and communicate concepts effectively. This section is where most students struggle due to the open nature of its problem solving. Understand that, even though it&rsquo;s technically only 44% of your total grade, this section is important to take your time on and review your answers!</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""color:#f39c12""><strong><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Arial,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">Here are the power tips to help you ace the PSLE science paper:</span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><strong>1. Roll up your sleeves and get in there.</strong></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">Learning exclusively from books can seem tedious when it comes to any subject, but it is especially true of science.<br />
<br />
Here&rsquo;s the good news: it doesn&rsquo;t have to be this way!<br />
<br />
<em><strong>Not at all! </strong></em><br />
<br />
Unfortunately, schools are under time constraint to cover the entire school <strong>curriculum</strong> until the end of term, so they usually do not have the time to perform engaging experiments.<br />
<br />
But there is nothing that prevents you from throwing on a lab coat and a pair of goggles on yourself and your child and learning about the world around us by carrying out some fun and <a href=""http://www.mindchamps.org/blog/science-experiments-try-primary-3-child-home/"" target=""_blank"">educational science experiements</a>&nbsp;at home. You can also use e-learning resources online to <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/blog/self-guided-learning-best-3-e-learning-resources"" target=""_blank"">promote self-guided learning</a>.<br />
<br />
This will not only help your child internalize the <strong>knowledge</strong> presented in the textbooks, but it will also help you bond with your little one and create some precious memories.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><strong>2. Don&rsquo;t be impatient and read the questions thoroughly.</strong></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">Children are notoriously impatient in every activity they do and exams are no exception.<br />
<br />
<a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/psle-tuition"" target=""_blank"">PSLE</a> science paper questions are often quite long in order to provide accurate information. However, some children may zone out and choose not to read the question as thoroughly as it is recommended and jump to conclusions after catching a glimpse of a few familiar terms.<br />
<br />
Needless to say this will increase the number of the mistakes they make. <strong>The devil is in the detail.</strong><br />
<br />
So, when doing practice tests make sure that your child <strong>reads all of the questions</strong> carefully from the beginning to the end, even if they seem confident what they are about.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><strong>3. Look out for the keywords!</strong></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">Help your child understand how to identify <strong>keywords</strong> in any given question. There are some obvious ones like &ldquo;explain&rdquo; or &ldquo;compare&rdquo; that tell your child exactly what is required of them.<br />
<br />
Other keywords may be specific scientific terms that they were taught during the term. Special attention should be paid to words such as &ldquo;always&rdquo;, &ldquo;never&rdquo;, &ldquo;some&rdquo;, &ldquo;not&rdquo; etc. as they may change the meaning of the question radically.<br />
<br />
Initially, during practice, it is a good idea to tell your child to <strong>underline</strong> the <strong>keywords</strong> in the questions. After a while their brain learns to distinguish them as they read so it will no longer be necessary. </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Arial,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">Chunking is relating a large amount of information that you need to remember, and dividing it into more manageable groups. For example, if you were asked to remember a 10-digit phone number but only had to remember it for a short period of time, you&#39;re more likely to remember it as two chunks of 3 numbers and one chunk of 4 numbers instead of ten chunks of 1 number. For example, to chunk 0715582461, you would try remembering: 071 558 2461. This seems like a small difference (you&#39;re really only adding a few spaces), but you&#39;d be surprised at how well it helps you remember subjects.</span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><strong>4. Different questions require different types of answers.</strong></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><a href=""https://www.seab.gov.sg/docs/default-source/national-examinations/syllabus/psle/2020_psle_subject_info/0009_y20_sy.pdf"" target=""_blank"">The PSLE paper consists of two parts</a>. First part contains multiple-choice questions and accounts for <strong>56 marks.</strong> Second part consists of open-ended questions and takes up <strong>44 marks</strong>. These two types of questions each demand a different approach.<br />
<br />
If questions are given in the imperative, and contain verbs such as&nbsp;&ldquo;state&rdquo;,&nbsp;&ldquo;name&rdquo; or &ldquo;list&rdquo; they require simple recall answers.<br />
<br />
You don&rsquo;t need to write at length when dealing with these questions. Just write down the names of objects, people etc. the <strong>examiners</strong> are looking for and move on, save the time.<br />
<br />
In the questions of <strong>open-ended variety</strong> it is important to answer fully and to show how you arrived at that specific conclusion. </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Arial,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">Before handing in your PSLE Science paper, always check through your answers to see if you got them right. Remember that the marking scheme tends to offer more marks for some questions than others, and you want to prioritize your time and attention on those questions. </span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Arial,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">Additionally, don&#39;t be afraid to stay the full length of the exam - if you still have time left over, it makes sense to use that time to double and triple-check what you think you know before handing your PSLE Science in.</span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><strong>5. Using scientific language will help you score more points. </strong></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">Even if your child knows the correct answer to the question, not being able to use the <strong>scientific</strong> style of writing and vocabulary may cost them a few points.<br />
<br />
Learning how to write things in a scientific manner is especially important in the <strong>booklet B </strong>which contains open-ended questions. A child must be able to recall the names of various processes and phenomena that they had learnt from the book.<br />
<br />
As well as this, they should be able to demonstrate that they understand the <strong>&ldquo;cause and effect&rdquo;</strong> relationships which exist between various phenomena. Simply regurgitating dry facts will be of little use in this part of the exam.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><strong>6. Applying familiar concepts to new situations.</strong></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">Never before seen pictures and diagrams are to be expected at the exam.<br />
<br />
They will be similar to those already studied but not 100 % the same. By asking the child to <strong>identify</strong> specific characteristics of the object <strong>examiners</strong> test how well the child has grasped basic scientific principles that cause those characteristics.<br />
<br />
The only way your child can successfully overcome this part of the test is if they truly understand the underlying principles. <u>Merely memorizing facts will not help you here</u>.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><strong>7. Practice. Practice. Practice. </strong></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif"">Practice makes perfect. It really does. If you are aiming for that A, then you better print some <a href=""http://www.testpapersfree.com/index.php"" target=""_blank"">past year exam papers from other schools</a>&nbsp;and get to work as early as possible. And remember, having a motivated child is a battle half-won, so make sure to practice positive reinforcement. </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Arial,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">If you&#39;re struggling with a particular part of PSLE Science, don&#39;t be afraid to put your hands up and ask for help from your teachers. Much of the time, the problem is simply one of not understanding the wording or perhaps not reading the question correctly. </span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Arial,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">Your teachers aren&#39;t allowed to give you the answer, but they can inform you if, for example, there is anything wrong with the way the question is written or if there are figures or graphs that you&#39;re not seeing. You might be surprised at how willing they are to help students who are keen on understanding the material and doing well on the exam!</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Arial,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">Finally, the best tip of all is to relax and take everything in stride. The PSLE Science isn&#39;t the end-all-be-all, and your performance on this test doesn&#39;t dictate what you&#39;ll do with the rest of your life. Try your best, of course, but make sure to balance your effort with the other parts of your life - health, friends, and family.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Arial,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">Remaining healthy in both body and mind is an incredibly important part of learning. Staying hydrated, for example, helps stave off fatigue and allows your brain to operate at full capacity. A well-rested mind is an effective mind, and this is especially important on a test like the PSLE. </span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Arial,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">What can you do to keep yourself healthy? Sleeping enough and eating right are probably two of the most obvious. Beyond that, find out which work-arounds you have. Is there something that helps you focus when you&#39;re studying? A certain song, a piece of gum, or something similar? Everybody is different, so not all techniques work for everybody. Experiment with different conditions and see what works best for you.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""color:#000000; font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>Local</strong> universities - NUS, NTU, SMU, SUTD, SIT and SUSS.&nbsp;<br />

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><span style=""color:black"">So how can a student choose between these two excellent options? </span></span></span><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><span style=""color:black"">What should you <strong>keep in mind</strong> before deciding which type of university to attend?</span> </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><span style=""color:black"">Here are the <strong>7&nbsp;things to look out for when making your choice</strong>. </span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><span style=""color:black"">1. How much will it cost?</span></span></span></strong></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><span style=""color:black"">Of course one of the main questions you ought to ask yourself is: <em>how much will your studies in either of these universities will cost? </em></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><span style=""color:black"">If you opt for a local university you may get your hands on the grant from the government which will help with your tuition. This will help you <strong>subsidize</strong> your studies and alleviate some of the money pressure. </span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><span style=""color:black""><strong>Read: </strong><a href=""https://blog.moneysmart.sg/education/singapore-university-education-cost/"" target=""_blank"">Moneysmart&nbsp;- NUS, NTU, SMU &amp; Other Singapore University Degrees &ndash; How Much Do They Cost in 2020?</a>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><span style=""color:black"">Public universities overall offer more <a href=""https://thesmartlocal.com/read/uni-scholarships/"" target=""_blank"">scholarships and financial aid to its students</a>. So if you are restricted financially this is an excellent option for you. </span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><span style=""color:black"">Whereas private universities usually have higher tuition fees and, in addition, <strong>may not offer government grants and subsidies</strong>. If you choose to attend one of them, you may have to pay for in entirely out of your own pocket.</span> </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><span style=""color:black"">Although recently private universities started attracting sponsors in order to provide financial aid to their students, and now they even offer student loans which are entirely interest-free.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><span style=""color:black"">Needless to say this differs from university to university, so make sure to do your <strong>research</strong> about the specific establishment you want to attend.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><strong><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:18px"">2. What are the requirements for admission? </span></span></strong></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:18px"">This is another difference that exists between local (public) and private universities.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:18px"">When public universities recruit their future students they take into consideration such thing as: <em>extracurricular engagement, exam results, relevant soft skills and other aspects.</em>&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:18px"">One could say that their method of recruitment is more <strong>holistic</strong>.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:18px"">Meanwhile the criteria for entering a private university are much <strong>stricter</strong>.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:18px"">Unlike public universities, private universities have specific predetermined grade thresholds for their potential students,&nbsp;and falling below the threshold will spoil your chances of attending a private university.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:18px"">For example a student must have a band score of&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/ielts-tuition"" target=""_blank"">at least 5.5&nbsp;in IELTS</a>&nbsp; in order to be allowed into the private university.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:18px"">There are some additional requirements you need to satisfy and they vary according to the program that you would like to apply for.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>3. Consider how the curriculum is structured.&nbsp;</strong> </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:18px"">Another thing to keep in mind when deciding between private and local universities is the <strong>structure</strong> of the curriculum.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:18px"">In some private universities the path towards your university degree may be structured in a slightly unusual manner. </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:18px"">For example, some programs may ask you to undergo some relevant <strong>vocational training</strong>.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:18px"">Some private universities&nbsp; may also allow you to take a full-time or, alternatively, a &nbsp;part-time course.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:18px"">Registering for a part-time course is ideal for those students who are planning to work during their&nbsp; studies. </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:18px"">However, if you end up opting for the part-time program take into consideration that it will increase the <strong>duration</strong> of the study significantly.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:18px"">Meanwhile the program that is offered by public universities allows you to focus fully on your student life.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:18px"">The program usually takes about <strong>four</strong> years to finish and you may even study two fields&nbsp;at the exact same place. </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>4. What about the accreditation?</strong> </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:18px"">Read: <a href=""https://www.therightu.com/guide/accreditations-and-rankings-what-is-the-difference-between-accredited-and-recognized-degrees"" target=""_blank"">Accreditation format in local and private universities</a>.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:18px"">On the one hand, in public universities the accreditation is provided to you personally, and it proves&nbsp;that you indeed graduated from that &nbsp;<strong>university</strong>.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:18px"">On the other hand, degrees in private universities are usually given out in <strong>cooperation</strong> with the partner institutions or universities.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:18px""><strong>5. Which university offers better chances of employment and higher salary?</strong> </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:18px"">This is a very important question.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:18px"">A <strong>good job and high salary</strong> are the reasons the majority of students decide to go to a university in the first place.&nbsp; <em>So, which one offers better prospects in this regard?&nbsp;</em></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:18px"">If you have graduated from a local university,&nbsp;then you may basically get a job almost anywhere. A wide variety of course choice means that you will probably have an easier time finding a job.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:18px"">However you should keep in mind that the salary may vary depending on the&nbsp; <strong>subjects</strong> you studied at university.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:18px"">On the other hand, those who have graduated from private universities find it slightly more difficult to get a job.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:18px"">The reason for this being a <strong>fierce competition</strong>.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:18px"">Although there are many private companies that seek privately educated students, they have to go through a rigorous recruitment process and only the best ones get hired.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:18px"">Similar to public universities your starting salary may also vary according to the program you have graduated from.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:18px"">According to <a href=""https://www.salary.sg/2020/graduate-employment-survey-2019-published-2020/"" target=""_blank"">Salary.sg, starting salaries&nbsp;for graduates of local and private universities can range from $3000-$4500, some going to as high as $5500 - $6000</a>.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:18px"">But it is vital to remember that while your degree&nbsp;helps you make a favorable first impression during the recruitment process,&nbsp;once you get the job <u>it doesn&#39;t really matter which university you graduated from</u>, private or local.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:18px"">Employers judge you based on your <strong>performance</strong> and if they notice that you are not worth your&nbsp; salary you will be shown the door.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:18px"">There have been numerous instances when graduates of local universities got picked for&nbsp;<strong>promotion</strong> over those who graduated from&nbsp; expensive private universities.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:18px"">This goes to show that your university degree will help you get your foot in the door, but whether you will be allowed to stay in the room and be <strong>successful</strong> in your career depends entirely on the amount of effort you make.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><strong><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:18px"">6. Does one of them rank higher? </span></span></strong></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:18px"">If you&#39;re the kind of person to whom ranking matters then you will be pleased to know that, on average, both local as well as private universities do quite well in this regard.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:18px"">University rankings determine the <strong>prestige</strong> of any given university and may have an effect on your future employment prospects.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:18px"">So make sure to do your research before you apply to the university of your choice.&nbsp; If you are a stickler for university rankings, here is the <a href=""https://www.timeshighereducation.com/student/best-universities/best-universities-singapore"" target=""_blank"">Time&#39;s Higher Education&#39;s World University Rankings. </a></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><strong><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:18px"">7. How big are the classes? </span></span></strong></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:18px"">Usually local universities tend to be <strong>larger</strong> in their capacity than private institutions, so they may have&nbsp; more people attending the same class.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:18px"">By comparison private universities may be slightly <strong>smaller</strong> which may help to create a more intimate learning environment and, in addition to this, in smaller classes students may get an opportunity to get to know their lecturers better.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:18px"">However a larger class size does not necessarily mean that the quality of education is lower. Remember in the end it all depends on how <strong>diligent</strong> you are.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:18px"">If you are truly passionate about the subject you are studying you will listen to the <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/university-tuition"" target=""_blank"">university professor</a>, make notes and to try to retain as much information as possible.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:18px"">There is <u>no enormous difference</u>&nbsp;between local universities and public&nbsp; ones.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:18px"">Overall, they offer similar opportunities to students. </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:18px"">However,&nbsp; there will be some areas where one particular university outshines the other.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-size:18px"">The quality of education differs depending on university and the course you are planning to pursue.&nbsp; In the end, only you&nbsp;can choose which university is <strong>most appropriate for your personal goals and your personality.&nbsp; </strong></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">This has been recognised to provide the student with&nbsp;<strong>complementary education</strong>, in order to mold the individual into a competent, confident contributor to the Singaporean society. </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">This allows the student to sample a variety of options prior to diving deeper into their niche.

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">This mantra holds true- whether it may be the voice of the ministry or that of the concerned parent. This article explores some reasons why.</span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif""><strong><u>Holistic learning</u></strong></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size:18px"">Holistic learning means learning and honing new skills <u>outside of what the classroom has to offer</u>. </span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size:18px"">Joining a CCA would mean that one does not merely focus on their academic studies. Instead, students are able to choose to <strong>expand on their interests</strong> and broaden their horizons by allowing themselves to contribute meaningfully to their chosen group.</span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size:18px"">Here are some benefits of why joining a CCA aids in holistic learning:</span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">Nurture talent and enriches the mind of an individual</span></span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">Students will learn how to work as a team by collaborating and working towards a common goal</span></span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">Develop healthy social-emotional competencies</span></span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">Effective communication</span></span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">Problem-solving skills</span></span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">Character development by being in an organised group with the same beliefs</span></span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">Prepares students for future challenges beyond the textbooks</span></span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">Instills discipline and commitment</span></span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">Learn values</span></span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">An outlet to express oneself</span></span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">Gives students an opportunity to contribute to society when trips are organised to old age homes or even through fundraising for certain causes</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif""><strong><u>Pursue interests</u></strong></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size:18px"">CCAs opens a window of opportunity for youth to expose themselves and experience new hobbies that they otherwise would not have been able to. </span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size:18px"">As a student in an environment that is conducive to <a href=""https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2015/05/28/404684712/non-academic-skills-are-key-to-success-but-what-should-we-call-them"" target=""_blank"">developing non-academic skills</a>, it really is a good chance for them to learn new things and acquire different talents amongst peers with similar interests.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">As many eager parents have introduced various activities to their children from a very early stage, the CCAs provide an excellent opportunity for the continued pursuit of these interests.</span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif""><em>The CCAs offered by schools these days are also way more interesting than what we had years ago</em>. </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">While they still offer the usual, common ones like soccer, canoeing, girl guides, there are new CCAs now such as hacking, magic, and even <strong>e-sports</strong> (of course, it depends on individual schools). </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><em><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">Completely unheard of a decade ago! </span></span></em></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">There is always something for everyone. </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">If one prefers a quiet space, being a library may offer the perfect outlet for the bookworm. In sharp contrast, the <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/music-lessons"" target=""_blank"">percussion section of the military brass </a>will suit the head-banging audiophile. </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif""><strong><u>Promoting friendships</u></strong></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size:18px"">One of the best aspects of joining a CCA is getting to network and <strong>socialise</strong> with the rest of the interest group despite their age, classes, or background. </span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><em><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size:18px"">New friendships are more easily forged with the platform of common interest. </span></em></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size:18px"">Everyone would also be on the equal playing field and have ample of opportunities to rise to leadership positions in the CCA depending largely on an individual&rsquo;s ability and commitment.</span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">Unexpected friendships can be formed with <strong>students from other schools</strong> when workshops are being organised jointly or it can even happen during inter-school competitions.</span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif""><strong>Expanding one&rsquo;s social circle</strong> always has its advantage for you never know who may be able to help you in the future when you are a working adult and vice-versa, you never know whose life you may impact for the better.</span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">Hanging around like-minded individuals would also likely create a sense of belonging and identity in the group as well as in school.</span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif""><strong><u>Overseas opportunities and collaborations</u></strong></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size:18px"">Some CCAs in schools gives students opportunities to travel overseas to learn more about their interest. Students in some CCA groups are able to participate in global events such as <a href=""https://www.imo-official.org/"" target=""_blank"">International Mathematical Olympiad</a> or <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/aseanschoolgames/"" target=""_blank"">ASEAN School Games. </a></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size:18px"">Some opportunities could even be workshops organised by international bodies such as NASA and some could also have the chance to go with their CCA group to build a house in Indonesia for the less fortunate.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">Facilitated by an increasingly globalised world, any of such organised trips give students perspective on how teens of similar age groups overseas are being groomed in their country, facilitates the exchange of ideas, and promote cultural immersion which will help <strong>develop cultural sensitivity</strong> and appreciation. </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">Who knows, one might find an interest in <a href=""https://www.tutorcity.sg/request-tutor"" target=""_blank"">picking up a new language</a> too!</span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif""><strong><u>Gives focus</u></strong></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size:18px"">Personally, I see CCAs as something that keeps students busy in school where they will be constantly monitored while providing them with a safe place to hang out throughout the day. </span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><em><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size:18px"">Without CCAs, I imagine there would be a lot of students gathering in malls or loitering at nearby places&nbsp; after school just to pass their free time. </span></em></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size:18px"">By joining a CCA, one is accountable to show up and stay through the day at least a couple of times per week instead of roaming free after classes daily where they could be <strong>more susceptible to mingling with the wrong crowd </strong>or with people of questionable characters. </span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size:18px"">Working parents can also set their minds at ease knowing where exactly their child is.</span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif""><strong><u>Bonus points</u></strong></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size:18px"">The<a href=""https://www.moe.gov.sg/"" target=""_blank""> Ministry of Education (MOE)</a> recognises students&rsquo; CCA contribution and <a href=""https://www.mrbrown.com/blog/2015/10/zero-point.html"" target=""_blank"">awards bonus points for O Levels</a> which is always helpful for you in your admission to a Junior College (JC), Polytechnic, or Institutes of Technical Education (ITE). </span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size:18px"">Depending on your contribution and participation levels during your stint, students may be entitled to <strong>score up to 2 bonus points</strong> if they have a stellar record. Free points while doing something you enjoy, why not?</span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif""><strong><u>A stepping stone for future courses and schools</u></strong></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size:18px"">If you are aiming to go to a prestigious or highly-sought-after course or school, <strong>focusing on your CCA</strong> alongside scoring good grades may help you clinch a spot. </span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size:18px"">Most applications would have hit the minimum score so what would help you stand out from the rest eventually would be your achievements in your CCA.</span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">The more awards you have representing your school for and won or the higher your position is in your CCA, the more credible you would seem compared to someone who did mediocrely in theirs. </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">Holding a <strong>leadership position</strong> especially helps make your testimonial look impressive and robust thus, portraying an image of someone who is an all-rounder. </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">Schools want to know that you are a goal-oriented individual who is able to work smart and balance personal development as well as academia.</span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif""><strong><u>Getting into elite schools</u></strong></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size:18px"">As a continuation from the previous point, for those who may not be so academically inclined, one of the most important points of a CCA that is not emphasised enough is that excelling in certain CCA groups and winning prizes at competitions for your school <strong>may give you a huge leg up in getting into an elite school</strong> - especially to a school that places a lot of emphasis on bagging home awards consistently. </span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size:18px"">Before this, I always had the assumption that everyone who came from elite schools was the cream of the crop with regards to their studies.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">Now I know that there are exceptions to this case and that is entering through <strong>recognition of your CCA achievements</strong> when you represent your school. </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">I had only found out about this much later in my life and if I had known earlier, I would have perhaps paid more attention to what I picked in school and worked towards excelling in it. </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><em><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">Of course, hindsight is always 20/20.</span></span></em></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">That being said, <u>one should not choose a CCA based on this point alone especially if you have no interest in it.</u> Otherwise, it is going to be an arduous journey trying to bring yourself to remain committed to it for so many years.</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">Hopefully, all the points above highlight the importance of having a CCA in Singapore schools. </span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">As a CCA requires a long term commitment,&nbsp; it is imperative that we weigh all the options available and choose our CCA wisely.

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><span style=""background-color:white"">But despite its considerable benefits, it still cannot replace the treatments that address these disorders.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><span style=""background-color:white"">One of the first scientists who studied positive psychology was Dr. Martin Seligman. According to <a href=""https://www.pursuit-of-happiness.org/history-of-happiness/martin-seligman-psychology/#:~:text=The%20Three%20Dimensions%20of%20Happiness&amp;text=According%20to%20Seligman%2C%20we%20can,and%203)%20meaning%20and%20purpose."" target=""_blank"">Dr. Seligman, there are three dimensions of happiness,</a> which are the pleasant life, the good life, and meaningful life. </span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><span style=""background-color:white"">If you satisfy your own basic human needs such as the need for companionship your body needs and the need for a safe environment, you are leaving a pleasant life. </span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><span style=""background-color:white"">In order to achieve a good life, you will need more <strong>mental work</strong>. You will need to pursue the activities that will help you reach your full potential and enhance your creativity. If you want to achieve what Dr. Seligman describes is the meaningful life, you need to use your strength to serve others in the society. </span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><span style=""background-color:white"">Numerous studies have shown that human beings feel more satisfied with their lives when their actions benefit others. Feeling satisfaction from bringing benefits to your fellow human beings is the definition of a meaningful life.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><span style=""background-color:white"">Dr. Seligman discussed the positive psychology movement during his TED Talk. <a href=""https://www.ted.com/talks/martin_seligman_the_new_era_of_positive_psychology?language=en"" target=""_blank"">Watch his&nbsp;video - &#39;New era of positive psychology</a>.&nbsp;The study of happiness is a major pillar upon which this movement rests. </span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><span style=""background-color:white"">As research proves the benefits of positive psychology, more and more individuals want to apply this method to their own lives. You can do this as well by engaging in some positive psychology exercises. </span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><span style=""background-color:white""><em>Think about something funny that has happened to you today.</em> </span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><span style=""background-color:white"">At the end of your day, look back at it and try to find something that amused you. You can write it down, or you can tell it to somebody else. Research shows that when we think about something humorous, it can boost happiness hormones in our body and make us feel good. </span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><span style=""background-color:white""><strong>Keep a journal.</strong> Write down everything that has happened to you during the day. Later on or even after several days, read it again and try to focus on the positives. Once the Passions have cooled and you are no longer in the moment, you may find that you had much more to be pleased with during that day than you thought. </span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><span style=""background-color:white""><strong>Visualize your future in a positive way</strong>. You can visualize a positive scenario that you want to play out in the future, or you can keep the so-called future journal where you write down your future goals and aspirations. </span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><span style=""background-color:white"">Think about a major goal you want to achieve in the near future and think about specific ways in which you can achieve this goal. <strong>Be mindful of your feelings. </strong></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Sylfaen,serif""><span style=""background-color:white"">Being self-aware and knowing how we feel at all times will help us manage those feelings better.

<p><strong><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"">1. Accessibility </span></span></strong></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"">Time is a precious resource that should be used wisely, especially by parents and students. If your school is in the eastern part of Singapore, would you want to spend time commuting to and fro a chemistry tuition centre located in the western part of Singapore? </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"">Remember that travelling time is an opportunity cost, which can be put to better use such as more revision time or simply rest.&nbsp;</span></span><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"">If a centre is highly recommended, ask if they offer online classes too.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"">2. Reputation of the Chemistry Tuition Centre</span></span></strong></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"">Credible chemistry tuition centres will help students achieve better results within a lesser time frame than less reputable ones. </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"">Look out for these indicators of a credible centre: </span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"">A quality curriculum framework</span></span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"">Testimonials of real students and the results they achieved after enrolling in the centre</span></span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"">Customer satisfaction reviews and ratings found on Google or Facebook</span></span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"">Centre&#39;s history such as year of establishment and number of students taught, do note that newer centres have fewer track records for assessment</span></span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"">Credentials of the tutors such as experience, professional qualifications and reviews</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif""><strong>3. Teaching Method of Tutors</strong></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"">Students who want to excel in chemistry will most likely achieve their goal with the help of a tutor who has an excellent and structured teaching methodology. This is especially true when it comes to chemistry; lessons should be designed to help students understand difficult concepts beyond the surface. </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"">A tutor can use different teaching methods to teach students, such as inquiry-based learning where students direct their own learning or collaborative learning such as group discussions, presentations and hands-on experiments. </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"">Speak to your tutor to know more about his or her teaching methods and whether they align with your learning style. </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"">Consider the personality of the tutor; some tutors are naturally more consultative and may be open to answering individual student questions over WhatsApp or email. Other tutors will motivate students using techniques such as positive reinforcement and cultivating a growth mindset.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"">4. Learning Materials</span></span></strong></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"">Request to look at the class slides and materials if possible. Better-quality chemistry tuition centres prepare their own custom teaching materials through a curriculum team, rather than simply using assessment books.</span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"">Some centres might include <a href=""https://tutorcity.sg/blog/how-to-improve-your-chemistry-grades-with-our-5-tried"" style=""color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline"">examination strategies and techniques</a> and useful revision notes in their lesson plans to help their students achieve stellar results.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"">5. Fees and Class Size</span></span></strong></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"">Consider the class size when determining whether the tuition fee fits your budget.</span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"">Smaller classes, with only 2 to 8 students, tend to have higher fees because the tutor can provide more personalised attention and explain complex chemistry concepts and facilitate deeper learning. </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"">In smaller chemistry group tuition, the tutor can adjust the pace of the lesson to suit each student&#39;s learning abilities. There are fewer distractions and better opportunities for quality interaction between students and teachers. </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"">On the other hand, larger chemistry group tuition classes may be less expensive and may better fit your budget but may not provide as much individual attention or be as conducive to learning.</span></span></p>

			<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><em><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"">In my one year of learning chemistry under Mr Kua&#39;s patient guidance, I have gradually been able to pick up and apply chemistry concepts more easily and have honed my answering techniques through the weekly practice that he provides. While in J1 I used to struggle with understanding chemistry concepts and applying them to questions (especially novel questions), his teaching, topical notes and revision questions have allowed me to achieve As in my A levels :) Mr Kua also provides extensive notes and practices questions covering numerous question types, sourced from different schools, and even includes practice for practical. Thank you Mr Kua!</span></span></em></p>

			<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><em><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"">Mr Kua&#39;s lessons have been a great help for me ever since I joined his class in the middle of J1!!! His lessons were engaging and he always asked us questions during his lessons to check if we were able understand the topic properly. Since Mr Kua was ahead of the school in terms of syllabus, I had ample time to complete my school&#39;s tutorial questions beforehand. Furthermore, he started the revision lessons for prelims and A levels early which allowed me to be exposed to a wide variety of questions. This really helped me during A levels especially with the novel questions! Thanks to Mr Kua&#39;s guidance, I was able to secure an A for H2 Chemistry! If you&#39;re struggling with chemistry, I highly recommend signing up for his lessons!!!</span></span></em></p>

			<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><em><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"">For many students, Chemistry is a challenging subject due to its abstract nature. However, Mr Kua simplifies the concepts in a way that makes them easier to understand. The notes, worksheets and quizzes provided are also helpful for revision. Moreover, Mr Kua was patient in clarifying any doubts I had, and even reviewed my examination papers so that I could concentrate on topics I was weaker at. His guidance allowed me to drastically improve my grades in a year. Personally, Mr Kua has made Chemistry a much more enjoyable subject and is one of Singapore&#39;s best Chemistry tutors. Thank you, Mr Kua!</span></span></em></p>

However, his lessons allowed me to understand chemistry concepts in a clearer light and appreciate the beauty of the subject. Mr. Wong is a chemistry tutor who is deeply passionate about what he does, particularly the way he guides his students.

Initially, chemistry wasnt a subject i look forward to during lessons as its always so confusing and there&#39;s too many things to remember. However, under Mr Lau&#39;s guidance, ive soon learnt how to tackle chemistry. He helped me to understand each concept thoroughly instead of purely memorising them. This enabled me to better understand and manage tougher topics later on. Mr Lau also supplemented us with his own notes during lessons that helped me so much when answering questions as each question/pointers he go throughs or say in class was essential in helping us answer questions and maximising marks from each question that we do. Even though his lessons may be fast, he never compromise each student&#39;s understanding. Mr Lau is definitely one of the most inspiring teachers ive met throughout my JC life. He is someone who is willing to go the extra mile to help you as long as we put in the hardwork. Under his guidance, my grades improved tremendously. Hence, i will strongly recommend Mr Lau as a chemistry tutor if yall are looking to join a good chemistry tuition!</span></span></em></p>

During the exam I used the tactics my science teacher thought me and I did very well in my test. I also attend math lesson and I was also able to solve complicated world problems.

A teacher is like a lighthouse guiding ships through dark times. You were the lighthouse for me guiding me through my storms for chemistry as under your guidance I really improved a lot.

			<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><em><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"">I was a student of Learners&#39; Lodge @ Bishan and I cannot fully put into words how grateful I am for the help of my tutors Mr Alex Xu and Mr Koh Chee Wee, as well as my centre manager Ms Shirley.</span></span></em></p>

			<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><em><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"">Walking into the Learners&#39; Lodge, you will be greeted by your friendly centre manager and her comrade, who takes the effort to know you by name, which is very comforting. Ms Shirley sent me reminders of lessons the day before and also helped to organise/reschedule classes when needed, which I am extremely thankful for with the hectic student life I experienced.</span></span></em></p>

			<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><em><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"">Mr Alex and Mr Koh were really quite the amazing people. They went beyond their roles as teachers and provided such genuine care and concern for their students. I especially loved that they were both sooo humble and patient, as they would hear out my (wildly flawed and nonsensical) arguments, before gracefully tackling any misconceptions, while being extremely kind in their words. Not only did this allowed me to grasp a deeper understanding of the subjects, it made me feel comfortable in raising doubts in a classroom setting because they never judge and are always so cool. On top of being there 24/7 on Whatsapp, they also provided a lot of additional practices which they had put in immense thought and effort in marking and leaving comments for. With Mr Alex and Mr Koh around, you will never feel like you&#39;re fighting alone. They even asked for photocopies of my test papers so they could go through my mistakes and clear up any queries I had that I did not dare raise in school. Both of them carried out their lessons in an engaging and clear way that never failed to make me feel mindblown :). On top of that, Mr Alex and Mr Koh shared notes that are godsent,,,, for reference, Mr Alex summerised over a hundred pages of my school notes in less than 20 pages, but 95% of the time his notes included all the content I needed to ace my tests. This was the same for Mr Koh&#39;s notes.</span></span></em></p>

			<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><em><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"">My experience at Learners&#39; Lodge is a very memorable and comforting one, and without Learners&#39; Lodge I could not have achieved the results I did for As. Thank you so much Learners&#39; Lodge! :D</span></span></em></p>

Mr Tony Tan is an extremely inspiring and highly dedicated teacher who not only explains the JC syllabus well but ensures that we understand what we learn and to enjoy the process as well. He goes out of his way to consolidate important ideas and key points to take note of and makes sure the student can discover their mistakes and learn why their method of approach is incorrect instead of only being fixated on the correct answer. Even virtual lessons are equally fruitful and he is happy to take time outside class to respond to further questions.

What sets him apart from other teachers is that Chu Wei is very meticulous and genuinely cares a lot for his students - this can be seen as he would always stay back after classes to interact with us on a personal level, and sometimes he would check on our wellbeing if we are doing alright. Every interaction with him is authentic, and every lesson consisted of a perfect balance of work and enjoyment. My grades jumped from a &lsquo;U&rsquo; to an &lsquo;A&rsquo; during my prelims in a mere span of 3 months!!</span></span></em></p>

			<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><em><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"">Aside from academic gains, what I have really learnt from Chu Wei is that maintaining a good teacher-student relationship is actually very crucial in a student&rsquo;s development. Although the time I spent here was a short one, the impact that Chu Wei has left on me will last a lifetime. I will always be thankful for his patience, his guidance, and most importantly his dedication and passion to help his students. Chu Wei has become a big inspiration to me and is also one of the main reasons why I am now pursuing a degree in teaching. Thank you so much Chu Wei!!</span></span></em></p>

Luckily i found this tuition center and i will forever be grateful to Mr. Lim for helping me do well for my exams. He takes his time with each student to go through all their problems as well as providing us with a conducive learning environment where we would be able to focus on our studies. His method of teaching allows us to absorb all the necessary information as well as extra bits and pieces that will help us in more ways than just in our studies.</span></span></em></p>

			<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><em><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"">Choosing to attend tuition classes with Chu Wei is like unsuspectedly walking into a FairPrice Xtra megastore, when all you expected was an ordinary mama shop. He&rsquo;s a whole package deal of teacher, mentor and personal cheerleader hitting you all at once. Sure, he makes sure to teach you the relevant syllabus, and yes, he&rsquo;s patient and concise when he&rsquo;s teaching. In fact, he makes sure to explain each math question using various diagrams and methods, until everyone in the class understands it.</span></span></em></p>

			<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><em><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"">However, he&rsquo;s so much more than just your tuition teacher with a mission to reteach what you should have learnt in school. He&rsquo;s an entrepreneur at heart- he&rsquo;s always constantly changing his teaching methods and platforms to best fit our learning styles and every tutorial question is freshly tailored to perfection; so that while they still retain their ability to make us forlornly question our ability to do math, they remain relevant.</span></span></em></p>

			<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><em><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"">Furthermore, he&rsquo;s splendidly candid and frank. He&rsquo;s unafraid to tell us to buck up when we get complacent or lazy, and he&rsquo;s certainly not hesitant to push us when we lack motivation to study. It may sound exhausting and awful, but honestly, it benefited all of us in the end.</span></span></em></p>

			<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><em><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"">Chu Wei is also considerably knowledgeable about a great wealth of things, like university application, and is always willing to advise us. He&rsquo;s incredibly supportive of the decisions we make, and is like, as I mentioned, our personal cheerleader. He is one of the rare few tutors I have ever had to be as concerned as he is about his students&rsquo; welfare, and their prospective careers.</span></span></em></p>

			<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><em><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"">The bottom line is- there may be an abundance of tuition teachers out there for your picking (after all, this is Singapore we&rsquo;re talking about), but there are only so many who will go beyond their duty as merely a tutor. </span></span></em></p>

			<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><em><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"">Frankly, I was never fond of lecture theatre- style tuition classes where you share a teacher with 30-50 other people because it always feels impersonal and distant. Hence, if you find that you want a tutor who values your opinion and takes time to adjust to your learning style and pace- he is the teacher for you.</span></span></em></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"">Unlike a class setting, where the tutor must divide his or her attention among all students, you will receive dedicated attention from a private tutor who can help you understand difficult chemistry concepts, cater to your unique learning style and address your weaknesses in the subject.</span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"">Private chemistry tuition can be a great option for students whose schedules are packed with co-curricular activities and training, as they may not be able to fit into specific timeslots at a tuition centre. </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><span style=""font-size:18px""><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif"">If you have a budget constraint, committed part-time tutors who have recently sat for A or O levels examinations and achieved stellar grades are in a good place to coach you. If you decide to go for a qualified MOE-trained tutor but find it costly, gather a few classmates and split the cost among yourselves, and have the lessons at a co-working place or the public libraries. </span></span></p>
